## Overview
Cody MCP Server is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for Cody that connects a custom AI assistant, powered by ChatGPT, to your applications. It is designed to work with business-specific data so you can run a tailored AI assistant inside compatible chat clients and tools.

## Features
- **MCP-compatible server** for integrating Cody as an AI assistant into MCP-enabled clients.
- **ChatGPT-powered assistant** that leverages OpenAI’s models behind the scenes.
- **Business-specific context**: intended to be trained on and work with your own business data and knowledge base.
- **Static server URL** for all clients: `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`.
- **Client-agnostic integration**: same MCP endpoint can be added to different chat clients that support MCP.
- **Authentication at configuration time**: you authenticate when adding the server to your client or application, not via separate URLs.
- **Configuration documentation**: a dedicated configuration page (via Pipedream) explains how to add and use the server in supported chat clients.
- **Pipedream-hosted**: powered by Pipedream Connect infrastructure.
