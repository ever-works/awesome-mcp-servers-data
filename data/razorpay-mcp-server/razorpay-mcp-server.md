## Description
Razorpay MCP Server is a Pipedream MCP integration that allows MCP-compatible agents and chat clients to interact with Razorpay’s payment processing and payout automation APIs. It is designed to support finance and business workflows such as accepting payments from customers and automating payouts to vendors and employees.

## Features
- **MCP integration for Razorpay**: Exposes Razorpay’s APIs through the Model Context Protocol so MCP-compatible agents can call them.
- **Payment processing**: Supports accepting payments from customers via Razorpay’s payment APIs (as exposed through the MCP server).
- **Payout automation**: Enables automated payouts to vendors, employees, and other recipients using Razorpay’s payout capabilities.
- **Static MCP server URL**: Uses a single static endpoint (`https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`) that works across supported clients.
- **Client-side authentication**: Authentication is performed when adding the server to the client or application, rather than per-URL.
- **Multi-client support**: Can be added to various MCP-compatible chat clients and applications.
- **Configuration documentation**: A dedicated configuration page (via Pipedream) provides setup and integration details.
