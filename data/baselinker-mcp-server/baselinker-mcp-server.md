## Description
BaseLinker MCP Server connects the BaseLinker e-commerce integration platform with the Model Context Protocol (MCP), enabling MCP-compatible agents and applications to orchestrate and integrate e-commerce workflows from a single place. It is delivered via Pipedream Connect as a static MCP server endpoint.

## Features
- **MCP-compatible server**: Exposes BaseLinker functionality through the Model Context Protocol so MCP-capable clients and agents can interact with e-commerce workflows programmatically.
- **Static server URL**: Uses a single, static MCP server endpoint that works across all supported clients:
  - `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`
- **Client-agnostic integration**: Designed to be added to various MCP-compatible chat or agent clients; configuration is done on the client side.
- **Authentication at connection time**: The URL is shared across users, with authentication handled when adding the server to an application / client.
- **Centralized e-commerce workflow orchestration**: Intended to let agents manage and integrate BaseLinker-based e-commerce workflows from one central MCP-connected environment.

## Setup & Configuration
- Add the MCP server URL `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2` to your MCP-compatible client.
- Authenticate when prompted by your application or chat client.
- Refer to the Pipedream MCP **Configuration** page for detailed, client-specific setup steps.
