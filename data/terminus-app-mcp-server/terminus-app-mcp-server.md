## Description
Terminus App MCP Server connects Terminus App’s UTM building and tracking capabilities to the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It enables automated, consistent creation and management of UTM-tagged URLs directly from MCP-compatible chat clients and applications.

## Features
- **MCP integration for UTM management**: Exposes Terminus App’s UTM building and tracking functions through the Model Context Protocol so MCP clients can generate and manage UTM URLs.
- **Consistent UTM URL generation**: Helps ensure UTM-tagged links are created with standardized parameters to maintain clean, consistent tracking data.
- **Automated tracking URL workflows**: Allows applications using MCP to programmatically build and track UTM URLs instead of doing it manually.
- **Static MCP server endpoint**: Uses a single static server URL for all clients:
  - `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`
- **Client-agnostic access**: The same MCP server URL can be added to different MCP-compatible chat clients and tools.
- **Authentication at configuration time**: Authentication is performed when you add the server to your application or chat client.
- **Pipedream Connect infrastructure**: Hosted and powered by Pipedream Connect, providing the MCP server runtime and connectivity.
- **Configuration documentation**: A dedicated configuration page (via Pipedream) describes how to add and use the server with supported clients.
