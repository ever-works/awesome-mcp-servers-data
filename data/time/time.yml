  - **Timezone conversion**: Utilities to convert times between different time zones.
  - **Localization support**: Helps align time outputs with different locales and regions.
  - **Temporal reasoning support**: Designed to make it easier for LLMs to reason about times, dates, and schedules.
  - **MCP integration**: Implemented as an MCP server so it can plug into MCP-aware development and AI tooling.
