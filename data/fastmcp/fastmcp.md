## Overview

fastmcp is a high-level Python framework for building Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and clients. It provides batteries-included abstractions for defining tools, resources, and transports, aiming to simplify creation and management of MCP-compatible services in Python.

## Features

- **High-level Python framework** for implementing MCP servers and clients.  
- **Abstractions for MCP concepts**:
  - Tools
  - Resources
  - Transports
- **“Batteries-included” design** to reduce boilerplate and simplify common MCP server patterns.
- **Project structure and tooling** (as visible from the repo layout):
  - `src/fastmcp` package containing the main framework implementation.
  - `examples` directory with sample usages and reference implementations.
  - `docs` directory for framework documentation.
  - `tests` directory with automated tests.
  - `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` indicating guidance for using fastmcp with agents and specific MCP clients.
- **Ecosystem integration** via standard Python project tooling:
  - `.pre-commit-config.yaml` for code quality and formatting hooks.
  - `.python-version` for managing compatible Python versions.
- **Open-source licensing** under the Apache-2.0 license.
