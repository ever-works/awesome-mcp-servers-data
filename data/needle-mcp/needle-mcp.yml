  # Needle MCP


  ## Overview

  Needle MCP is a production-ready Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for
  Needle that adds retrieval‑augmented generation (RAG) and long‑term memory
  capabilities to LLM-based agents. It lets you search and retrieve information
  from your own documents so models can answer questions using your private
  data.


  ## Features

  - **MCP server for Needle**
    - Implements a server compatible with the Model Context Protocol for use in Needle-based agents.
  - **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
    - Enables agents to search across your own documents and use retrieved content as context for language model responses.
  - **Long-term memory for LLMs**
    - Designed to provide persistent knowledge and context, so agents can reference prior or stored information rather than relying only on short prompts.
  - **Document search and retrieval**
    - Supports querying and fetching relevant data from user-provided document collections.
  - **Agent-building support**
    - Intended to be used as a backend component for building and running AI agents with richer context.
  - **Containerization support**
    - Includes a `Dockerfile` for containerized deployment.
  - **Python-based project**
    - Managed with `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`, indicating a modern Python packaging and dependency setup.
  - **Smithery integration metadata**
    - Provides a `smithery.yaml` configuration and is published on Smithery for easier MCP server discovery and usage.

  ## Pricing

  - **Free & open source**
    - Distributed via a public GitHub repository; usage is governed by the license found in the `LICENSE` file of the project.
