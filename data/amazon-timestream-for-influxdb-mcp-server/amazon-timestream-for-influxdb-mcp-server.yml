  # Amazon Timestream for InfluxDB MCP Server


  **Category:** Database & Messaging MCP Servers  

  **Brand:** Amazon Web Services (AWS)


  ## Overview

  Amazon Timestream for InfluxDB MCP Server is intended to expose Amazon
  Timestream for InfluxDB via an MCP-compatible interface, using InfluxDB-style
  operations so time‑series workloads can be managed and queried from MCP
  clients.


  > Note: The referenced source page currently returns a 404 error, so only
  high‑level information from the item metadata is available.


  ## Features

  Based on the available description, the server is expected to offer:


  - **MCP server integration**  
    - Implements the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server role so MCP‑compatible clients can connect and issue requests.

  - **Amazon Timestream for InfluxDB backend**  
    - Uses **Amazon Timestream for InfluxDB** as the underlying time‑series database engine.

  - **InfluxDB‑compatible operations**  
    - Exposes operations compatible with InfluxDB (e.g., time‑series write and query semantics) so tools that speak InfluxDB protocols or query formats can interact via MCP.

  - **Time‑series workload support**  
    - Designed for **time‑series data** such as metrics, logs, IoT signals, and application telemetry.
    - Enables management and querying of time‑series workloads through MCP.

  - **Querying via MCP clients**  
    - Allows MCP clients (such as IDE plugins, AI tools, or custom apps that speak MCP) to run queries against Amazon Timestream for InfluxDB.
