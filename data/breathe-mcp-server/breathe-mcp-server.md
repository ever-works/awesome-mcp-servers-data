## Description
Breathe MCP Server is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration for Breathe, an HR software platform focused on people-first HR management. It enables compatible chat or AI clients to connect to Breathe via a standardized MCP server endpoint.

## Features
- **Standard MCP Endpoint**: Uses a single static MCP server URL for all clients: `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`.
- **Client-Agnostic Integration**: The same server URL can be added to different chat or AI applications that support MCP.
- **Authentication at Connection Time**: Users authenticate when adding the server to their application, rather than using separate URLs per client.
- **Pipedream Connect Backend**: Hosted and powered by Pipedream Connect infrastructure.
- **Configuration Guidance**: Documentation available via a configuration page to help set up the MCP server in supported clients.
