## Overview
Easyship MCP Server exposes Easyship’s global shipping and logistics platform to MCP‑compatible tools and workflows. It allows MCP-aware applications (such as chat clients or other automation tools) to interact programmatically with Easyship for crowdfunding and e‑commerce shipping use cases.

## Features
- **MCP-compatible shipping server** – Provides an MCP endpoint that can be added to any MCP-aware application or chat client.
- **Static server URL** – Uses a single static MCP server URL (`https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`) that works for all clients.
- **Account-based authentication** – Authentication occurs when the server is added/configured in the client, enabling secure access to Easyship resources.
- **Easyship platform exposure** – Surfaces Easyship’s global shipping and logistics capabilities to tools and workflows built on MCP.
- **Crowdfunding & e-commerce focus** – Designed around use cases common to crowdfunding campaigns and online stores.
- **Configuration via Pipedream UI** – Connect an Easyship account and select a client from the Pipedream interface to initialize usage.
- **Tool discovery (via MCP)** – Once connected, MCP clients can load and list available actions/tools exposed by the server (e.g., shipping-related operations), though specific tools/actions are not detailed on the page.

## Integration & Usage
- Add the MCP server to a compatible chat client or app using the static URL.
- Authenticate with your Easyship account when prompted by the client.
- Use the client’s MCP interface to load, view, and invoke shipping/logistics tools provided by the server.
