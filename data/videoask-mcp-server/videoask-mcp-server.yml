  # VideoAsk MCP Server


  **Category:** Business & Commerce – MCP Servers  

  **Brand:** VideoAsk  

  **Source:** https://mcp.pipedream.com/app/videoask


  ## Overview

  VideoAsk MCP Server is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server integration that
  connects to VideoAsk, enabling tools and applications to create, manage, and
  use interactive video conversations for lead capture and customer engagement.
  It is powered by Pipedream Connect and is accessible via a single static MCP
  endpoint.


  ## Features

  - **MCP integration for VideoAsk**: Provides an MCP-compatible server that
  connects directly to the VideoAsk platform.

  - **Interactive video conversation support**: Enables creation and use of
  interactive video conversations within MCP-enabled clients.

  - **Lead capture workflows**: Allows tools to leverage VideoAsk experiences to
  capture leads through video-based forms and flows.

  - **Customer engagement flows**: Supports managing video conversations aimed
  at improving customer engagement and communication.

  - **Static MCP server URL**: Uses a single, static endpoint for all clients:
    - `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`
  - **Client-agnostic configuration**: The same server URL works across
  different MCP-compatible chat clients; configuration is done in the client by
  adding this server URL.

  - **Authentication at setup**: Authentication happens when adding the server
  to an application or chat client (per-client auth rather than per-URL).

  - **Central configuration reference**: A configuration page (via Pipedream
  Connect) provides additional setup instructions for different clients.


  ## Installation / Setup

  1. Copy the MCP server URL: `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`.

  2. Add this URL as an MCP server in your supported chat client or application.

  3. Complete the authentication flow when prompted by the client.

  4. (Optionally) Refer to the full configuration documentation on the Pipedream
  Connect configuration page for client-specific setup steps.
