## Overview

ApeRAG is an open-source, production-ready retrieval‑augmented generation (RAG) platform from ApeCloud. It combines Graph RAG, vector search, and full‑text search, and can be used as a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server to build RAG systems over heterogeneous knowledge sources. It is designed for scalable deployment, including Kubernetes environments.

## Features

- **RAG Platform**
  - End-to-end framework for building retrieval‑augmented generation applications.
  - Supports heterogeneous knowledge sources.

- **Graph RAG**
  - Graph-based retrieval for reasoning over relationships in data.
  - Suited for complex, interconnected knowledge graphs.

- **Multi-modal Indexing**
  - Indexes multiple content types (e.g., text and other modalities) for unified retrieval.

- **Search Capabilities**
  - Vector search for semantic retrieval.
  - Full-text search to support keyword-based queries.
  - Combines different retrieval strategies in one system.

- **MCP Server Support**
  - Usable as a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server.
  - Integrates with MCP-compatible tools and agents for retrieval and augmentation.

- **AI Agents Integration**
  - Built-in support for AI agents to orchestrate retrieval and generation.

- **Scalable Deployment**
  - Designed for production usage.
  - Kubernetes (K8s) deployment support for scaling and orchestration.

- **Open Source**
  - Licensed under the Apache-2.0 license.
  - Repository structure includes configuration, deployment, docs, models, tests, and web UI components.
