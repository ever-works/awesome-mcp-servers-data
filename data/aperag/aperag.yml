  ## Overview


  ApeRAG is an open-source, production-ready retrieval‑augmented generation
  (RAG) platform from ApeCloud. It combines Graph RAG, vector search, and
  full‑text search, and can be used as a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server to
  build RAG systems over heterogeneous knowledge sources. It is designed for
  scalable deployment, including Kubernetes environments.


  ## Features


  - **RAG Platform**
    - End-to-end framework for building retrieval‑augmented generation applications.
    - Supports heterogeneous knowledge sources.

  - **Graph RAG**
    - Graph-based retrieval for reasoning over relationships in data.
    - Suited for complex, interconnected knowledge graphs.

  - **Multi-modal Indexing**
    - Indexes multiple content types (e.g., text and other modalities) for unified retrieval.

  - **Search Capabilities**
    - Vector search for semantic retrieval.
    - Full-text search to support keyword-based queries.
    - Combines different retrieval strategies in one system.

  - **MCP Server Support**
    - Usable as a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server.
    - Integrates with MCP-compatible tools and agents for retrieval and augmentation.

  - **AI Agents Integration**
    - Built-in support for AI agents to orchestrate retrieval and generation.

  - **Scalable Deployment**
    - Designed for production usage.
    - Kubernetes (K8s) deployment support for scaling and orchestration.

  - **Open Source**
    - Licensed under the Apache-2.0 license.
    - Repository structure includes configuration, deployment, docs, models, tests, and web UI components.
