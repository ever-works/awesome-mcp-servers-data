  # AeroLeads MCP Server


  ## Overview

  The AeroLeads MCP Server is an integration that connects AeroLeads’ lead
  generation capabilities with MCP-compatible chat or agent applications. It
  enables workflows that discover business email addresses and phone numbers for
  leads and companies from multiple online sources.


  ## Features

  - **Email and phone discovery**: Find business email addresses and phone
  numbers for people and companies.

  - **Multi-source lead data**: Gathers contact information from LinkedIn,
  Google, Yahoo, and other online sources.

  - **MCP server endpoint**: Uses a static MCP server URL
  (`https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`) that can be added to any compatible client or
  application.

  - **Account-based configuration**: Connect an AeroLeads account and select the
  appropriate client to start using tools within your chat or agent environment.

  - **Tool-based actions**: Exposes AeroLeads functionality as MCP “tools”
  (actions) that can be invoked programmatically from supported clients.
