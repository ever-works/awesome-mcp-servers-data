  # Stack AI MCP Server


  **Category:** Workflow Automation MCP Servers  

  **Brand:** Stack AI


  ## Description

  An MCP server that connects MCP-compatible clients to Stack AI’s no‑code
  enterprise AI workflows and automations via Pipedream Connect.


  ## MCP Server URL

  - Static MCP endpoint (used by all supported clients):  
    `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`
  - Authentication is performed when adding the server to your
  client/application.


  ## Features

  - **No-code enterprise AI integration**: Exposes Stack AI’s no-code enterprise
  AI workflows and automations to MCP clients.

  - **Standard MCP compatibility**: Designed to be consumed by any client that
  supports the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

  - **Single static endpoint**: Uses one static server URL for all clients,
  simplifying configuration.

  - **Authentication on connection**: Authentication occurs when the server is
  added in the client, rather than requiring per-client URLs.

  - **Pipedream Connect integration**: Hosted and powered by Pipedream Connect
  infrastructure.

  - **Configurable in chat clients**: Intended to be added to compatible chat or
  agent clients via their MCP configuration.


  ## Getting Started

  client.

  - Follow the client’s instructions to add a new MCP server and authenticate.
