  ## Overview

  The iContact MCP Server is an MCP Server integration that lets MCP-based
  agents and tools interact with iContact’s email marketing platform. It is
  designed to support email campaign management and marketing automation
  workflows via a standard MCP server endpoint.


  ## Features

  - **MCP-based integration with iContact** – Exposes iContact email marketing
  capabilities to MCP-compatible agents and tools.

  - **Static MCP server URL** – Uses a single, static endpoint for all clients:
    - `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`
  - **Per-client authentication** – Authentication occurs when adding the MCP
  server to your application, allowing the same URL to be reused across
  different clients/accounts.

  - **Email marketing campaign management** – Supports interaction with
  iContact’s email marketing features for building and managing campaigns (as
  described at a high level in the item description).

  - **Marketing automation workflows** – Intended to enable automation around
  email campaigns, such as triggering and managing marketing flows via
  MCP-compatible tools.

  - **Multi-client compatibility** – Can be added to different chat or agent
  clients that support MCP, using the same configuration URL.


  *(The Pipedream UI mentions “available tools” and “actions,” but they are
  dynamically loaded and not enumerated in the provided content, so specific
  tools/actions cannot be listed.)*
