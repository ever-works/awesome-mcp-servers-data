# Referral Rocket MCP Server

**Category:** Business & Commerce · MCP Servers  
**Brand:** Referral Rocket  
**Integration Type:** MCP Server (via Pipedream Connect)

Referral Rocket MCP Server is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server integration that lets MCP-based agents and applications programmatically work with Referral Rocket referral program data.

## Overview

The server exposes Referral Rocket functionality through a static MCP endpoint managed by Pipedream. Any compatible MCP client can connect to this endpoint and, once authenticated, use it to manage or analyze referral program data.

**MCP Server URL**  
`https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`

This URL is the same for all clients; authentication is handled when you add the server to your MCP-enabled application.
