# Storeganise MCP Server

**Category:** Business & Commerce MCP Servers  
**Brand:** Storeganise  
**Slug:** storeganise-mcp-server

## Description
Storeganise MCP Server exposes Storeganise’s self‑storage business automation capabilities—such as bookings, customer management, and billing—to MCP‑compatible agents and chat clients via a single static MCP endpoint.

## Features
- **MCP-compatible server**: Provides a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that can be added to any supported MCP client or chat application.
- **Single static endpoint**: Uses a universal MCP server URL (`https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`) that works across clients; authentication is handled when the server is added to the application.
- **Self‑storage automation access**: Surfaces Storeganise functionality related to:
  - Bookings and reservations
  - Customer management
  - Billing and payments
- **Multi-client setup guidance**: Documentation and configuration instructions available via a central configuration page for different chat clients.
- **Hosted by Pipedream Connect**: The MCP server is operated through Pipedream’s infrastructure, removing the need to self-host the MCP endpoint.

## Technical Details
- **MCP Server URL:** `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`
- **Integration model:** Add the MCP server to an MCP‑compatible chat client, then authenticate within that client.
