  **Brand:** Printify


  ## Description

  Printify MCP Server is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that lets
  MCP-compatible agents interact with Printify to manage print-on-demand
  workflows. It enables working with custom products (e.g., t‑shirts, phone
  cases, and many other items) that Printify prints and ships directly to
  customers.

    - Static MCP server URL: `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`  
    - Single URL works for all supported MCP clients

    - Integrates with Printify’s catalog of 900+ customizable products (e.g., apparel, accessories, phone cases).  
    - Supports workflows where designs are applied to products for sale.

  - **Order and fulfillment handling**

  - **Client-agnostic usage**  
    - Designed to be added to multiple MCP-compatible chat clients / applications.
