### Overview
The AWS CDK MCP Server is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server focused on AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) workflows. It enables infrastructure-as-code development and security/compliance checks by exposing AWS CDK–related capabilities to MCP-compatible clients.

### Features
- **AWS CDK–focused MCP server**
  - Designed specifically for workflows built with the AWS Cloud Development Kit.
  - Integrates infrastructure-as-code (IaC) development into MCP-aware tools and agents.

- **Infrastructure-as-code workflows**
  - Supports interactions that align with CDK-style declarative infrastructure definitions.
  - Facilitates programmatic management of infrastructure resources via IaC patterns.

- **Security and compliance checks**
  - Provides mechanisms (via MCP interactions) to run or integrate security and compliance checks against CDK-defined infrastructure.
  - Helps incorporate compliance validation into development and review workflows.

- **Model Context Protocol integration**
  - Exposes CDK-related operations over MCP so that compliant clients (editors, agents, tooling) can use the server as a backend.
  - Fits into the broader MCP ecosystem for standardized tool–agent communication.
