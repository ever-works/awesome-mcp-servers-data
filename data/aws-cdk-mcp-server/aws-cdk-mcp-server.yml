  ## AWS CDK MCP Server


  **Category:** Cloud & DevOps MCP Servers  

  **Brand:** Amazon Web Services (AWS)  

  **Website:** https://modelcontextprotocol.io/mcp/servers/cdk-mcp-server


  ### Overview

  The AWS CDK MCP Server is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server focused on AWS
  Cloud Development Kit (CDK) workflows. It enables infrastructure-as-code
  development and security/compliance checks by exposing AWS CDK–related
  capabilities to MCP-compatible clients.


  ### Features

  - **AWS CDK–focused MCP server**
    - Designed specifically for workflows built with the AWS Cloud Development Kit.
    - Integrates infrastructure-as-code (IaC) development into MCP-aware tools and agents.

  - **Infrastructure-as-code workflows**
    - Supports interactions that align with CDK-style declarative infrastructure definitions.
    - Facilitates programmatic management of infrastructure resources via IaC patterns.

  - **Security and compliance checks**
    - Provides mechanisms (via MCP interactions) to run or integrate security and compliance checks against CDK-defined infrastructure.
    - Helps incorporate compliance validation into development and review workflows.

  - **Model Context Protocol integration**
    - Exposes CDK-related operations over MCP so that compliant clients (editors, agents, tooling) can use the server as a backend.
    - Fits into the broader MCP ecosystem for standardized tool–agent communication.

  *(Note: The source page currently returns a 404, so only high-level
  capabilities explicitly mentioned in the item description are available.)*
