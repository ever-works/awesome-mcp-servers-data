## Description
The Hashnode MCP Server is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server hosted on Pipedream that connects applications and workflows to Hashnode, a developer-focused blogging and community platform. It provides a unified MCP endpoint that clients can use to interact with Hashnode through their chat or automation environments.

## MCP Server URL

- This URL is shared across clients; authentication is handled when adding the server to your application.

## Features
- **Unified MCP Endpoint**  
  - Single static MCP server URL (`https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`) usable across compatible clients.

- **Client-Agnostic Integration**  
  - Designed to be added to different MCP-enabled chat clients or applications.  
  - Configuration instructions are provided per client via the "Configuration" page.

- **Hashnode Integration via Pipedream**  
  - Connects your MCP-enabled tools to Hashnode, enabling interaction with the Hashnode blogging and developer community platform.

- **Authentication Flow**  
  - Authentication is performed when you add the server to your chosen application, rather than requiring a different URL per client.

  - Central configuration reference available via the **Configuration page** (linked from the app page) to guide setup across clients.
