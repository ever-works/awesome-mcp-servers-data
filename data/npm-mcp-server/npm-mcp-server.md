**Category:** Development Tools – MCP Servers  
**Brand:** npm  
**Source:** https://mcp.pipedream.com/app/npm

## Overview
The npm MCP Server exposes the npm (Node Package Manager) ecosystem as a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server. It enables MCP-compatible tools and automations to discover and use Node.js packages directly from npm.

## Features
- **MCP-compatible npm integration**  
  - Provides an MCP server interface for interacting with the npm ecosystem.  
  - Designed for use with MCP-aware chat clients, applications, and automations.

- **Static server endpoint**  
  - Uses a single static MCP server URL: `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`.  
  - The same URL works across all supported clients.

- **Authentication at client setup**  
  - Authentication is handled when you add the server to your client or application.  
  - Allows connecting your npm-related capabilities to different MCP clients.

- **Client-agnostic configuration**  
  - Supports multiple MCP chat clients; you select your client and follow tailored setup steps.  
  - Central configuration via a shared configuration page.

- **npm / Node.js package ecosystem access**  
  - Oriented around the Node.js/npm package ecosystem (package discovery and usage from npm within MCP tools).
