  ## Description

  PrintNode MCP Server exposes PrintNode’s fast cloud printing service via a

  and interact with USB weighing scales directly from automations.

  adding the server to your application.)

  - **Supports all PrintNode-compatible printers** for remote and automated
  printing.

  programmatically.

  multiple chat and automation clients.

  - **Workflow and automation friendly**, enabling printing and scale reads from
  scripts, bots, and other automated processes.
