  - Allows users to trigger NectarCRM-related actions and workflows directly from their chat interface (where supported by the client).

- **Sales and CRM focus**
  - Connects to NectarCRM, which is oriented around customer relationship management and sales acceleration workflows.
  - Intended to help manage and accelerate sales processes through integrated tools.

- **Configuration guidance**
  - Provides in-app instructions to:
    - Connect a NectarCRM account.
    - Select a client (e.g., chat client) to start using the server.
    - Access a dedicated configuration page for full setup details.

- **Tool/action exposure (via MCP)**
  - Designed to load and expose "available tools" and actions from NectarCRM through the MCP interface (exact tools are dynamically loaded and not listed in the provided content).
