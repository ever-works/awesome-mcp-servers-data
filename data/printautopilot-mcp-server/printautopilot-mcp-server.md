## Overview
The PrintAutopilot MCP Server is an MCP-compatible endpoint, powered by Pipedream Connect, that lets clients and applications interface with PrintAutopilot’s print automation services. It exposes a static MCP server URL that can be added to supported chat clients or other MCP-enabled tools to route print jobs to connected printers.

## Features
- **MCP-compatible server** – Implements the Model Context Protocol so it can be used by MCP-compatible tools and chat clients.
- **Static server URL** – Uses a single, fixed endpoint for all clients:  
  `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`
- **Client-side authentication** – Authentication is performed when adding the server to your application or client, rather than requiring a per-client URL.
- **Print automation integration** – Bridges between applications and PrintAutopilot’s print automation services so apps can initiate print jobs to connected printers.
- **Multi-application connectivity** – Designed to connect printers to “any application” that can interface with MCP servers.
- **Chat client support** – Can be added to compatible chat clients; setup instructions are provided per client via the configuration documentation.
- **Central configuration reference** – A full Configuration page (linked from the product page) explains how to add and configure the server in various environments.
- **Pipedream Connect-powered** – Runs on Pipedream Connect infrastructure, inheriting its integration and connectivity capabilities.

## Usage
- Use the static MCP server URL `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2` when registering the server in your MCP-compatible application or chat client.
- Follow client-specific instructions from the linked Configuration page to complete setup and authentication.
