  ## Overview

  OceanBase MCP Server is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides a
  controlled interface for AI assistants to interact with OceanBase databases.
  It focuses on secure, structured database exploration and analysis by exposing
  a limited set of operations.

  - **Table discovery**: list available tables in the connected OceanBase
  database.

  - **Data access**: read data from tables through the MCP interface.

  - **Query execution**: execute SQL queries against an OceanBase database.

  - **Controlled operations**: exposes only a defined set of database operations
  to AI assistants to improve safety.

  - **Structured access pattern** for database exploration and analysis,
  suitable for MCP-enabled clients (e.g., AI assistants).
