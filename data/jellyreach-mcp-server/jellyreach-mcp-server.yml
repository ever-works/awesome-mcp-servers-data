  - **MCP Server URL**: `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`


  ## Description

  Jellyreach MCP Server exposes Jellyreach’s customer messaging and journey
  orchestration capabilities through the Model Context Protocol. It allows
  compatible clients (e.g., AI chat interfaces or agent frameworks) to trigger,
  manage, and personalize customer messaging flows directly through an
  MCP-compliant server endpoint.


  ## Features

  - **Static MCP Endpoint**: Uses a single static MCP server URL
  (`https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`) that works across clients.

  - **Client-Agnostic Integration**: The same endpoint can be added to multiple
  MCP-compatible chat or agent clients.

  - **Authentication at Client Setup**: Authentication is performed when adding
  the server to your application, not via different URLs.

  - **Customer Messaging Orchestration**: Enables orchestration of automated,
  personalized, and timely customer messaging flows via MCP.

  - **Preference-Aligned Messaging**: Designed to help deliver messages aligned
  with customer preferences.

  - **Pipedream Connect Integration**: Operates as part of the Pipedream Connect
  infrastructure, benefiting from its integration and automation environment.


  ## Getting Started

  1. Copy the MCP server URL: `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`.

  2. Add this URL as an MCP server in your chosen chat or agent client.

  3. Authenticate within your client when prompted.

  4. Configure messaging flows according to your Jellyreach setup and the
  client’s configuration options (see the platform’s configuration
  documentation).
