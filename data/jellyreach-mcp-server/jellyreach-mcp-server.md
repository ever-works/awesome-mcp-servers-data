Jellyreach MCP Server exposes Jellyreach’s customer messaging and journey orchestration capabilities through the Model Context Protocol. It allows compatible clients (e.g., AI chat interfaces or agent frameworks) to trigger, manage, and personalize customer messaging flows directly through an MCP-compliant server endpoint.

## Features
- **Static MCP Endpoint**: Uses a single static MCP server URL (`https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`) that works across clients.
- **Client-Agnostic Integration**: The same endpoint can be added to multiple MCP-compatible chat or agent clients.
- **Authentication at Client Setup**: Authentication is performed when adding the server to your application, not via different URLs.
- **Customer Messaging Orchestration**: Enables orchestration of automated, personalized, and timely customer messaging flows via MCP.
- **Preference-Aligned Messaging**: Designed to help deliver messages aligned with customer preferences.
- **Pipedream Connect Integration**: Operates as part of the Pipedream Connect infrastructure, benefiting from its integration and automation environment.
