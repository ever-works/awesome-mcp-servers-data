  # Platform.ly MCP Server


  ## Overview

  The Platform.ly MCP Server connects Platform.ly’s marketing automation and CRM
  platform to Model Context Protocol (MCP) clients, allowing AI-powered
  applications to interact with Platform.ly for automated marketing and CRM
  workflows.


  - **Type:** MCP server / integration

  - **Category:** Business & Commerce – MCP Servers

  - **Integrates:** Platform.ly (marketing automation & CRM) ↔ MCP-compatible
  clients

  - **MCP Server URL:** `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`


  ## Features

  - **MCP-compatible server endpoint**  
    - Provides a static MCP server URL (`https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`) usable across clients.  
    - Designed to be added to various MCP-capable chat or AI applications.

  - **Platform.ly account connectivity**  
    - Connects to a Platform.ly account from within the MCP client.  
    - Supports selection of a specific Platform.ly client/account context after connection.

  - **Authentication at client level**  
    - Uses a single, static server URL for all users; authentication occurs when adding the server to each application, so individual users authenticate separately.

  - **Tooling exposure to MCP clients**  
    - Exposes "tools" (actions) from Platform.ly to MCP clients, enabling automated use of Platform.ly capabilities via MCP.  
    - Tools are dynamically loaded (“Loading actions…”, “Loading available tools…”) based on the connected account.

  - **Marketing automation & CRM workflow enablement**  
    - Designed to bridge Platform.ly’s CRM and marketing automation features (e.g., campaigns, contact management) into MCP environments so AI agents can trigger or manage workflows.

  - **Multi-client setup guidance**  
    - Supports configuration with different MCP-capable chat clients, with per-client instructions referenced from the configuration flow.

  - **Central configuration documentation**  
    - Linked configuration page for full setup instructions within Pipedream’s environment.
