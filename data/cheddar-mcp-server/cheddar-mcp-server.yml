  # Cheddar MCP Server

  **Brand:** Cheddar  

  **Source:** https://mcp.pipedream.com/app/cheddar


  ## Description

  Cheddar MCP Server is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server wrapper for
  Cheddar that exposes Cheddar’s subscription and usage‑based billing
  capabilities programmatically via MCP. It allows applications and chat-based
  clients to interact with Cheddar’s billing features through a standardized
  server endpoint.


  ## Features

  - **MCP server wrapper for Cheddar**: Provides a standardized MCP interface to
  Cheddar’s billing platform.

  - **Subscription billing access**: Enables programmatic access to Cheddar’s
  subscription billing features via MCP.

  - **Usage-based billing access**: Exposes usage-based billing functionality
  through the MCP server.

  - **Static MCP server URL**: Uses a single, static MCP endpoint for all
  clients:
    - `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`
  - **Client-agnostic endpoint**: The same MCP server URL works with multiple
  chat clients and applications.

  - **Authentication at client setup**: Authentication is handled when
  adding/configuring the MCP server in your application.

  - **Configuration guidance**: Can be integrated by following client-specific
  setup instructions or the general configuration documentation (via the
  Configuration page on Pipedream).
