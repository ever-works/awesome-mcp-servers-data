## Description
CallerAPI MCP Server is an integration that exposes CallerAPI’s caller identification and enrichment capabilities through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It allows compatible chat or agent clients to look up and enrich phone-related data via API as part of their workflows.

## Features
- **Caller identification via API**  
  Use CallerAPI’s service to identify callers and retrieve associated data programmatically.

- **Data enrichment**  
  Enrich records or workflows with additional information tied to phone numbers (e.g., for business or contact context).

- **MCP-compatible server**  
  Implements the Model Context Protocol so it can be added as a server to MCP-aware chat or agent clients.

- **Static MCP server URL**  
  A single static endpoint (`https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`) is used for all clients; authentication is handled when you add the server to your application.

- **Works with multiple chat clients**  
  Designed to be integrated into various MCP-compatible chat or assistant applications, configured per client.

- **Hosted and managed by Pipedream**  
  The integration is provided through Pipedream Connect, so you don’t need to host your own MCP server.
