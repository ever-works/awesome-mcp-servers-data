## Overview
The Sitecreator.io MCP Server is a Pipedream-hosted Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that lets MCP-compatible tools and chat clients interact programmatically with the Sitecreator.io website-building platform. It provides a static server endpoint that can be added to applications to enable website and page management capabilities through MCP tools.

## Features

  - Exposes Sitecreator.io functionality as MCP tools/actions.  
  - Designed to integrate with MCP-enabled chat clients and applications.

- **Static MCP server URL**

    - `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`
