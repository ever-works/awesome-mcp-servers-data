  # Sitecreator.io MCP Server


  **Category:** Content Management MCP Servers  

  **Slug:** `sitecreatorio-mcp-server`


  ## Overview

  The Sitecreator.io MCP Server is a Pipedream-hosted Model Context Protocol
  (MCP) server that lets MCP-compatible tools and chat clients interact
  programmatically with the Sitecreator.io website-building platform. It
  provides a static server endpoint that can be added to applications to enable
  website and page management capabilities through MCP tools.


  ## Features

  - **MCP-compatible server for Sitecreator.io**  
    - Exposes Sitecreator.io functionality as MCP tools/actions.  
    - Designed to integrate with MCP-enabled chat clients and applications.

  - **Static MCP server URL**  
    - Uses a single static endpoint for all clients:  
      - `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`  
    - Authentication is performed when adding the server to your application.

  - **Pipedream-hosted integration**  
    - Operates as a Pipedream MCP server for Sitecreator.io.  
    - Managed and delivered through Pipedream’s integration environment.

  - **Client-agnostic configuration**  
    - Can be added to various chat clients that support MCP.  
    - Configuration instructions are available per client via the “Configuration” page.

  - **Connection to Sitecreator.io account**  
    - Connect your Sitecreator.io account within Pipedream to begin using tools.  
    - Supports selecting a client (project/context) after connecting.

  - **Programmatic website building support**  
    - Intended to enable programmatic control over Sitecreator.io’s website-building features (e.g., creating and managing professional websites) through MCP tools.  
    - Actual tools/actions are loaded dynamically (“Loading actions…”, “Loading available tools…”), indicating extensible operations exposed via MCP.

  ## Usage

  - Configure Sitecreator.io within Pipedream.  

  - Copy the static MCP server URL: `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`.  

  - Add the server to your MCP-compatible app or chat client.

  using the available tools.
