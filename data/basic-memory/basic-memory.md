## Features

- **Local-first knowledge layer**  
  - Operates on your local filesystem rather than relying on remote storage.  
  - Uses your existing Markdown notes and documents as the primary data source.

- **Semantic graph from Markdown**  
  - Parses Markdown files to build a semantic graph of concepts, entities, and relationships.  
  - Enables structured navigation and retrieval of related information across documents.

- **Persistent memory for LLM conversations**  
  - Maintains stateful memory across multiple AI/LLM sessions.  
  - Allows AI agents to recall prior context without users repeatedly re-explaining projects or documents.

- **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server**  
  - Implements the Model Context Protocol to make local knowledge accessible to compatible AI tools and agents.  
  - Exposes notes and documents as structured, queryable resources through MCP tools and APIs.

- **Structured, queryable memory layer**  
  - Presents your documents as a unified memory layer that can be queried semantically.  
  - Supports AI assistants and agents in retrieving relevant facts, notes, and context from your local files.

- **Markdown-centric workflow**  
  - Designed around Markdown files as the primary content format.  
  - Integrates easily into existing note-taking and documentation workflows that already use Markdown.
