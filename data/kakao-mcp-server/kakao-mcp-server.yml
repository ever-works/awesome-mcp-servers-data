  # Kakao MCP Server


  **Category:** Messaging MCP Servers  

  **Brand:** Kakao  

  **Slug:** kakao-mcp-server


  ## Description

  Kakao MCP Server is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server integration that
  connects Kakao’s communication and daily-life services to MCP-compatible
  clients and automations. It allows applications and chat clients that support
  MCP to interact with Kakao via a unified server endpoint.


  ## Features

  - **MCP-compatible server**: Exposes Kakao functionality through the Model
  Context Protocol for use in compatible clients and automation platforms.

  - **Static server URL**: Single, reusable endpoint for all clients:  
    `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`
  - **Client-agnostic integration**: Designed to be added to various MCP-capable
  chat clients and tools using the same server URL.

  - **Authentication at connection time**: Authentication occurs when adding the
  server to an application or client (no per-client custom URL required).

  - **Configuration documentation**: Supports a configuration flow via a
  dedicated configuration page (for setup steps and options).


  ## Setup

  1. Use the static MCP server URL: `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`.

  2. Add this server URL to your MCP-compatible chat client or application.

  3. Complete the authentication flow during server addition.

  4. Optionally review the detailed configuration instructions on the
  configuration page.
