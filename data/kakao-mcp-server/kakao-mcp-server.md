**Slug:** kakao-mcp-server

## Description
Kakao MCP Server is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server integration that connects Kakao’s communication and daily-life services to MCP-compatible clients and automations. It allows applications and chat clients that support MCP to interact with Kakao via a unified server endpoint.

## Features
- **MCP-compatible server**: Exposes Kakao functionality through the Model Context Protocol for use in compatible clients and automation platforms.
- **Static server URL**: Single, reusable endpoint for all clients:  
  `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`
- **Client-agnostic integration**: Designed to be added to various MCP-capable chat clients and tools using the same server URL.
- **Authentication at connection time**: Authentication occurs when adding the server to an application or client (no per-client custom URL required).
- **Configuration documentation**: Supports a configuration flow via a dedicated configuration page (for setup steps and options).

## Setup
1. Use the static MCP server URL: `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`.
2. Add this server URL to your MCP-compatible chat client or application.
3. Complete the authentication flow during server addition.
4. Optionally review the detailed configuration instructions on the configuration page.
