  - Allows LLMs to interact with GitHub Actions resources via structured tools rather than manual UI usage.
- **Workflow management**
  - Designed to enable managing GitHub Actions workflows (e.g., triggering or controlling workflows) from within an LLM session.
- **Automation integration**
  - Intended for CI/CD and automation use cases, connecting GitHub Actions with AI-driven agents or tools.
- **GitHub-focused**
  - Built specifically around GitHub Actions, aligning with GitHub’s CI/CD ecosystem.

## Use Cases
- Triggering and managing CI/CD workflows from an LLM interface.
- Integrating GitHub Actions into AI agents for automated development workflows.
- Building custom MCP tools that control GitHub Actions jobs and workflows.
