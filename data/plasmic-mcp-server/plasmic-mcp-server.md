## Overview
Plasmic MCP Server is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that enables MCP-based tools and chat clients to interact with Plasmic’s visual page and content builder. It is designed to let teams visually build pages and manage content across different tech stacks, enabling rapid UI and content delivery.

## Features
- **MCP-based integration**: Exposes Plasmic as an MCP Server so MCP-compatible tools and clients can interact with Plasmic.
- **Visual page and content building**: Supports visually building pages and managing content using Plasmic’s builder.
- **Works across tech stacks**: Intended to be used with “any tech stack,” enabling integration into varied front-end or back-end environments.
- **Static MCP server endpoint**: Uses a single static server URL that works for all supported MCP clients:  
  `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`
- **Per-client authentication**: Authentication is handled when adding the MCP server to each application or chat client.
- **Client-agnostic setup**: Can be added to multiple chat clients; documentation is organized by client type with additional configuration details available.

## Configuration
