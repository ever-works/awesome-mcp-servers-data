# Clearly Defined MCP Server

Helping FOSS projects be more successful through clearly defined project data.

## Overview
The Clearly Defined MCP Server is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables MCP-compatible clients to retrieve and work with curated metadata for free and open source software (FOSS) projects. It focuses on providing structured project data such as licenses, attribution, and security-related information, helping with compliance and open-source governance workflows.

- **Type:** MCP server
- **Category:** Security & attestation MCP servers
- **Use cases:** Compliance, open-source management, software composition analysis, metadata enrichment
- **MCP endpoint:** `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`

## Features
- **Curated FOSS metadata access**  
  Retrieve structured information about FOSS projects, including:
  - License data
  - Attribution details
  - Security-related metadata

- **MCP-compatible server**  
  Exposes a static MCP server URL (`https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`) that can be added to any compatible MCP client or chat application.

- **Client-agnostic static URL**  
  A single static endpoint works across different MCP clients; authentication occurs when the server is added to the application.

- **Account-based configuration**  
  Connect a Pipedream account and select a client to configure and start using the server.

- **Tooling integration (MCP tools)**  
  Provides MCP tools ("available tools") that clients can load to interact with ClearlyDefined data for retrieval and analysis workflows. (Specific tool list is not exposed in the provided content.)

## Integration
- Add the MCP server URL directly into supported MCP/chat clients.
- Configuration guidance is available via a dedicated configuration page on Pipedream.
