  - **License:** MIT


  ## Description


  Neon MCP Server is an open-source Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that
  allows AI agents to interact with the Neon serverless Postgres platform. It
  connects to the Neon Management API and Neon databases so agents can perform
  database-related operations in a programmatic, structured way.


  ## Features


  - **MCP-compatible server** for integrating with AI agents and MCP-capable
  clients.  

  - **Neon Management API integration** to interact with Neon’s management layer
  (e.g., projects, branches, databases) via an MCP server interface.  

  - **Database operations support** against Neon serverless Postgres databases,
  enabling AI agents to work with data programmatically.  

  - **Example/client implementation** under the `mcp-client` directory to
  demonstrate how to connect to and use the server.  

  - **Scripts and tooling** (via the `scripts` directory) to support development
  and operational workflows.  

  - **Bun-based setup** indicated by `.bun-version`, aligning the project with
  the Bun JavaScript runtime ecosystem.  

  - **Container-friendly project layout** (e.g., presence of `.dockerignore`) to
  facilitate Docker-based workflows.  

  - **Environment-based configuration** using `.env.example` for defining
  required environment variables.


  ## Pricing


  - **Cost:** Free and open source under the MIT License.  

  - **Paid plans:** None listed; no commercial pricing information is provided
  in the repository.
