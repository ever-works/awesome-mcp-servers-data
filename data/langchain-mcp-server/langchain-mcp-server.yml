  ## Description
  LangChain MCP server (MCP-Langchain) is a management system for configuring and controlling language model servers and tools. It acts as a bridge between language models and external tools/services, providing a unified interface for starting, monitoring, and configuring server processes that expose capabilities for language models.

  ## Features
  - **Unified Server Management:** Centralized dashboard (ServerControlsDashboard) for managing multiple server instances, displaying their status, and controlling their lifecycle (start/stop).
  - **Server Configuration:** Structured forms (ServerConfigFormView) for creating and editing server configurations, specifying how servers start, their capabilities, and communication parameters.
  - **Status Monitoring:** Real-time status badges (running, stopped, error) for each server instance.
  - **Capability Management:** Ability to refresh and update server capabilities, and synchronize active capabilities with the LLM system.
  - **Configuration Management:** Create, edit, and delete server configurations through a user-friendly interface.
  - **API Service Layer:** Abstraction layer for frontend-backend communication, supporting both HTTP requests and WebSocket connections for real-time data streaming.
  - **Extensibility:** Designed for easy extension and integration with new tools, agents, and workflows.
  - **Frontend Architecture:** Vue-based frontend for intuitive server control and monitoring.
  - **Composability:** Supports composable chains and adapters for connecting AI agents to knowledge bases and structured data.
