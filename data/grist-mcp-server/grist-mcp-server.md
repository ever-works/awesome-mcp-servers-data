## Description
Grist MCP Server is an MCP-compatible server that connects to Grist’s spreadsheet-like data management platform and exposes Grist APIs to MCP tools via Pipedream. It allows applications and chat-based MCP clients to interact with Grist data as if working with a spreadsheet-backed database.

## Features
- **MCP-compatible endpoint**: Provides a static MCP server URL (`https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`) for use with any compatible client.
- **Grist integration**: Connects MCP tools to Grist’s spreadsheet-style data management platform.
- **API exposure**: Exposes Grist APIs through the MCP server so tools can read from and write to Grist.
- **Authentication at client setup**: Uses a single static URL for all clients; authentication occurs when adding the server to each application.
- **Works with multiple chat clients**: Can be added to supported chat-based MCP clients (LLM / chat applications) for interactive access to Grist data.
- **Configuration documentation**: Full configuration details are available via a dedicated configuration page on Pipedream.
