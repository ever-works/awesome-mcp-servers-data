# Zoho Catalyst MCP Server

## Overview
Zoho Catalyst MCP Server connects AI agents and MCP-compatible clients to Zoho Catalyst, a highly scalable serverless backend platform for building and deploying applications. It exposes Zoho Catalyst’s compute and service APIs into MCP workflows via a static MCP server endpoint.

## Features
