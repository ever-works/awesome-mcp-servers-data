- Exposes functionality as an MCP server, compatible with Claude and other MCP-capable clients.
- Supports creating new notes following the Zettelkasten style (atomic, focused notes).
- Supports linking notes to each other to build a graph of related ideas.
- Enables exploration of existing notes and their connections via MCP tools.
- Facilitates synthesis of information across multiple notes for knowledge work and documentation.
- Organized source structure with separate `src`, `docs`, and `tests` directories for extensibility and maintenance.
