  ## Overview

  Hookdeck MCP Server is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that integrates

  It exposes webhook management and observability capabilities so agents can
  reliably receive, inspect, and route webhooks.


  ## Features

    - Provides a static MCP server endpoint: `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`  
    - Can be added as a server to different chat clients or MCP-enabled applications.

  - **Webhook management for agents**  
    - Exposes Hookdeck’s webhook handling capabilities to MCP agents.  
    - Designed so agents can programmatically receive and route webhooks.

  - **Webhook observability**  
    - Provides visibility into incoming webhooks and their processing.  
    - Supports inspection and debugging of webhook events via Hookdeck’s infrastructure.

  - **Reliability and delivery guarantees**  
    - Built on Hookdeck’s reliable webhook infrastructure to reduce missed or lost webhooks.  
    - Useful for queue-like, event-driven integrations where consistent delivery matters.

  - **Client-agnostic configuration**  
    - Single static URL works across multiple MCP clients.  
    - Authentication is handled when adding the server to each application.  
    - Configuration guidance available per client and via a central configuration page.
