# SmartReach MCP Server

MCP Server integration for SmartReach, enabling automated cold email outreach and follow‑up campaigns directly via your email account.

## Overview
The SmartReach MCP Server lets you connect SmartReach’s cold email and follow‑up automation capabilities into MCP-compatible chat clients and applications via a single static server URL.

## Features
- **MCP-compatible integration**: Exposes SmartReach functionality through a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server endpoint.
- **Static server URL**: Uses a single, client-agnostic endpoint for all integrations:
  - `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`
- **Client-agnostic setup**: The same server URL works with any supported MCP chat client or application.
- **Authentication at connection time**: You authenticate when adding the server to your application rather than using client-specific URLs.
- **Configuration guidance**: Integration details and advanced options are available via the linked configuration page.

## Setup
1. Copy the MCP server URL: `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`.
2. Add the server to your MCP-compatible chat client or application.
3. Authenticate when prompted during server setup.
4. Optionally, review the full configuration instructions on the provider’s configuration page.
