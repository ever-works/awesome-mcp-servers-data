  ## Features


  - **MCP server integration for Brevo**  
    - Exposes Brevo functionality via the MCP (Model Context Protocol) so MCP-aware tools and workflows can interact with Brevo.
  - **Multi-channel campaign orchestration**  
    - Designed to support workflows that coordinate:  
      - Email campaigns  
      - SMS messaging  
      - Chat-based communication  
      - Other Brevo-supported channels for customer relationship management.
  - **Static MCP server endpoint**  
    - Single, reusable MCP server URL for all clients:  
      - `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`  
    - Same endpoint is used across different MCP-compatible chat clients and tools.
  - **Client-agnostic usage**  
    - Can be added to multiple MCP-enabled chat clients and applications.  
    - Works with any client that supports configuring an MCP server endpoint.
  - **Authentication handled on client setup**  
    - Authentication occurs when adding the MCP server to an application or client, keeping the public endpoint static.
  - **Configuration resources**  
    - Documentation and examples for adding the server to different chat clients are available via the configuration page (linked from the app page).
