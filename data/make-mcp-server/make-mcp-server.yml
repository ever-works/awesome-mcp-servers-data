  A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that allows you to turn Make.com scenarios into callable tools for AI assistants, enabling workflow automation and AI integration.

  ## Features
  - Connects to your Make.com account and detects all scenarios with "On-Demand" scheduling.
  - Parses and resolves input parameters for each scenario, providing meaningful parameter descriptions to AI assistants.
  - Allows AI assistants to invoke Make scenarios with the appropriate parameters.
  - Returns scenario outputs as structured JSON for easy interpretation by AI systems.
  - Enables bidirectional communication between AI assistants and existing Make automation workflows.
  - Supports integration with clients like Claude Desktop.
  - Maintains automation logic in Make while exposing it for use by AI systems.
  - Written in TypeScript and JavaScript.
  - Open source under the MIT license.

  ## Usage
  - Requires NodeJS and an MCP client (e.g., Claude Desktop App).
