## Overview
RSS MCP Server is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for working with RSS feeds. It enables MCP-compatible tools and clients to subscribe to, fetch, and process syndicated RSS content within AI or chat-based workflows.

- **MCP Server URL:** `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`
- **Usage:** Add this MCP server URL to any compatible chat client or application, then authenticate within that client.

## Features
- **MCP-compatible RSS access**: Exposes RSS feed operations through the Model Context Protocol so AI/chat clients can interact with RSS content.
- **Syndicated content handling**: Designed for subscribing to, fetching, and processing RSS-based syndicated content such as news and blog updates.
- **Static server endpoint**: Uses a single static URL (`https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`) that works across all supported MCP clients.
- **Client-agnostic integration**: Can be added to different chat clients or MCP-compatible applications using the same server URL.
- **Authentication at client level**: Authentication is handled when you add the server to your application or chat client.

## Integration & Configuration
- Add the server URL to your MCP-capable chat client or app.
