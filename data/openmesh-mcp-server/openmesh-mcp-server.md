# OpenMesh MCP Server

**Category:** MCP Middleware & Orchestration  
**Brand:** OpenMesh  
**Website:** https://metorial.com/integration/openmesh  
**MCP Endpoint:** `https://api.openmesh.dev/mcp`

## Overview
The OpenMesh MCP Server exposes OpenMesh capabilities over the Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing AI agents and workflows running on Metorial (and other MCP-compatible environments) to query, manipulate, and analyze mesh data structures via natural language instead of writing code.

## Features
- **Natural-language mesh manipulation**
  - Perform operations on mesh data structures through conversational prompts.
  - Offload low-level mesh programming details to an MCP-accessible service.

- **Mesh data querying**
  - Inspect and query mesh properties (e.g., topology- or geometry-related attributes).
  - Access mesh data structures as read-only resources where appropriate.

- **Geometric operations**
  - Run geometric computations on meshes via MCP tools.
  - Use AI agents to orchestrate complex sequences of geometry/mesh operations.

- **3D model visualization support**
  - Enable workflows that visualize 3D models processed by OpenMesh.
  - Integrate visualization steps into AI-driven pipelines without manual coding.

- **No-code / low-code workflows**
  - Interact with OpenMesh from AI assistants and automation pipelines without writing integration glue code.
  - Suitable for developers who want to script behavior in natural language instead of direct API calls.

- **Metorial integration**
  - Deploy the OpenMesh MCP Server directly on Metorial.
  - Combine OpenMesh with other Metorial integrations (e.g., databases, web search, GitHub) for end-to-end workflows.

## Use Cases
- Analyze and inspect mesh data structures in AI-assisted design or simulation workflows.
- Automate geometric transformations and mesh processing tasks via AI agents.
- Integrate mesh analysis into broader pipelines involving data retrieval, code generation, or reporting.
