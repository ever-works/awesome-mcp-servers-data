  # Writer MCP Server

  **Brand:** Writer  

  **Website:** https://mcp.pipedream.com/app/writer


  ## Overview

  Writer MCP Server integrates Writer’s generative AI platform with the Model
  Context Protocol (MCP). It enables MCP-compatible tools and agents to create
  and manage on-brand business content at scale using Writer’s
  enterprise-focused generative AI.


  ## Features

  - **MCP-compatible server** for integrating Writer with any MCP-aware client
  or agent.

  - **Static MCP endpoint** usable across clients:  
    `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`
  - **Client-agnostic setup**: the same server URL works with multiple chat or
  agent clients that support MCP.

  - **Authentication on connect**: authentication is performed when you add the
  server to your application (no per-client URL changes required).

  - **Business-focused generative AI**: designed for teams that need consistent,
  on-brand content generation and management.

  - **Scalable content operations**: supports creating and managing business
  content at scale through MCP tools and agents.

  available via the linked configuration page.
