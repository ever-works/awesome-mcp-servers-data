## Model Context Protocol Auth Extensions

### Overview
The **Model Context Protocol Auth Extensions** repository defines additional authorization mechanisms for the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It provides reusable specifications, patterns, and components to help secure MCP servers and manage authentication flows beyond the core MCP specification.

### Features
- **Authorization extensions to MCP**  
  - Adds authorization-focused extensions on top of the core Model Context Protocol specification.  
  - Targets scenarios where MCP servers need more advanced or standardized security and auth behavior.

- **Reusable auth components and patterns**  
  - Offers patterns to secure MCP servers consistently.  
  - Defines mechanisms for managing authentication flows between clients and MCP servers.

- **Specification-focused repository**  
  - Contains draft specifications under `specification/draft` for evolving or experimental auth extensions.  
  - Designed to complement the main MCP specification hosted in the primary MCP spec repository.

- **Governance & maintenance**  
  - Follows the official [Model Context Protocol Governance](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/community/governance) process.  
  - Maintainers dedicated specifically to authorization extensions are listed in `MAINTAINERS.md`.  
  - Adheres to Model Context Protocol project-wide policies, including code of conduct, contributing guidelines, and security policy.

- **Open GitHub repository structure**  
  - Source-managed via GitHub with standard project files (`README.md`, `package.json`, `LICENSE`, `.github` configuration).  
  - Suitable as a reference implementation or standard for MCP implementers who need robust auth extensions.

### Pricing
- **Free and open source.**  
  Licensing details are provided in the repository’s `LICENSE` file.
