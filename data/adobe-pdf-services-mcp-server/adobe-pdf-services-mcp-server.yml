  # Adobe PDF Services MCP Server


  **Category:** Document Management MCP Servers  

  **Brand:** Adobe  

  **Slug:** `adobe-pdf-services-mcp-server`


  ## Overview

  The Adobe PDF Services MCP Server is an MCP-compatible integration that
  exposes Adobe PDF Services capabilities—such as creating, converting,
  transforming, and running OCR on PDFs—through a unified MCP server endpoint.
  It is hosted via Pipedream and can be added as a remote MCP server to
  compatible applications.


  ## Features

  - **MCP-compatible PDF service**  
    - Provides an MCP server interface for Adobe PDF Services.  
    - Accessible via a static server URL: `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`.

  - **PDF creation and generation**  
    - Create new PDF documents from supported inputs (details not listed on page, but implied by “create” capability).

  - **PDF conversion**  
    - Convert files to and from PDF formats (e.g., common document formats to PDF, and PDF to other formats, as supported by Adobe PDF Services).

  - **PDF transformation**  
    - Perform transformations on PDFs (such as rearranging, modifying, or otherwise processing documents, as supported by Adobe PDF Services).

  - **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)**  
    - Run OCR on PDFs to extract text from scanned or image-based documents.

  - **Centralized configuration via Pipedream**  
    - Configure Adobe PDF Services within Pipedream.  
    - Connect an Adobe account and select a client configuration to begin using the tools.

  - **Static MCP endpoint for all clients**  
    - One static URL works across different MCP-compatible clients; authentication is handled when the server is added to each application.

  - **Client-agnostic integration**  
    - Designed to be added to various chat or MCP-capable applications.  
    - Client-specific setup instructions are available via the Pipedream interface.
