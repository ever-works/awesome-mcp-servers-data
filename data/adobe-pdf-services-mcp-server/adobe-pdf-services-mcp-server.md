## Overview
The Adobe PDF Services MCP Server is an MCP-compatible integration that exposes Adobe PDF Services capabilities—such as creating, converting, transforming, and running OCR on PDFs—through a unified MCP server endpoint. It is hosted via Pipedream and can be added as a remote MCP server to compatible applications.

## Features
- **MCP-compatible PDF service**  
  - Provides an MCP server interface for Adobe PDF Services.  
  - Accessible via a static server URL: `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`.

- **PDF creation and generation**  
  - Create new PDF documents from supported inputs (details not listed on page, but implied by “create” capability).

- **PDF conversion**  
  - Convert files to and from PDF formats (e.g., common document formats to PDF, and PDF to other formats, as supported by Adobe PDF Services).

- **PDF transformation**  
  - Perform transformations on PDFs (such as rearranging, modifying, or otherwise processing documents, as supported by Adobe PDF Services).

- **Centralized configuration via Pipedream**  
  - Configure Adobe PDF Services within Pipedream.  
  - Connect an Adobe account and select a client configuration to begin using the tools.
