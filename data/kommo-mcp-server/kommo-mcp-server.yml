  # Kommo MCP Server


  Messenger-based sales CRM integration for the MCP framework.


  ## Overview

  Kommo MCP Server connects the Kommo messenger-based sales CRM with
  MCP-compatible clients, exposing CRM functionality (such as conversations,
  contacts, and pipelines) via a standardized server endpoint.


  **MCP Server URL:**

  ```text

  https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2

  ```

  This is a static URL used by all clients; authentication occurs when you add
  the server to your application.


  ## Features

  - **MCP-compatible server endpoint**  
    - Single static MCP server URL (`https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`) for all clients.  
    - Designed to be added to MCP-capable chat or agent clients.

  - **Kommo CRM integration**  
    - Programmatic access (via MCP) to Kommo’s:  
      - Messenger-based conversations.  
      - Contacts and customer records.  
      - Sales pipelines and related CRM data.

  - **Client-agnostic setup**  
    - Works with multiple MCP-enabled chat clients.  
    - Authentication is handled during server addition in the client, not via a custom URL.

  - **Configuration resources**  
    - Additional configuration details available via a dedicated configuration page (linked from the app page).
