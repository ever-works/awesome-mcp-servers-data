## Overview
- **Type:** MCP server integration
- **Platform:** Dokan multivendor marketplace (WordPress-based)

## Features
Based on the available information and the stated integration purpose, the Dokan MCP Server is intended to:

- **Connect MCP clients to Dokan**
  - Acts as a bridge between any MCP-compatible client and a Dokan-powered multivendor marketplace.
  - Exposes Dokan marketplace capabilities via MCP so they can be accessed programmatically.

- **Programmatic interaction with marketplace features**
  - Enables automation and tooling around typical multivendor marketplace operations (e.g., interacting with vendors, products, and orders) through MCP-compatible clients.
  - Designed to support tasks you’d normally perform within a Dokan multivendor storefront, but through an MCP interface.

- **Unified static endpoint**
  - Uses a single, static MCP server URL (`https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`) that works for all supported clients.
  - Simplifies configuration across different MCP-enabled chat or dev tools.

- **Client-agnostic configuration**
  - Intended to be added to multiple MCP clients (e.g., various chat UIs or dev tools) using the same URL.
  - Configuration details and client-specific setup are documented via the referenced configuration page (not included in the provided content).
