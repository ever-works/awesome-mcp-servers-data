  ## Overview

  The Crisp MCP Server is an integration that connects the Crisp all-in-one
  business messaging platform to MCP-compatible chat clients. It centralizes
  conversations, data, and knowledge workflows in one place by exposing Crisp
  capabilities through the MCP protocol.


  ## Features

  - **MCP server endpoint**: Static MCP server URL
  (`https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`) usable by any compatible client.

  chat clients; authentication is handled when you add the server to your
  application.

  - **Access to Crisp platform**: Connects to Crisp’s business messaging
  environment, enabling workflows around conversations, customer interactions,
  and related data.

  - **Centralized workflows**: Supports gathering teams, conversations, data,
  and knowledge in a unified interface via your MCP client.


  ## Usage

  - Add the MCP server URL `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2` to your MCP-compatible
  chat client.
