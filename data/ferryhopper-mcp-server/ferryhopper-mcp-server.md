## Overview
Ferryhopper MCP Server is an open Model Context Protocol (MCP) server by Ferryhopper that exposes ferry travel and booking–related data and actions to MCP‑compatible applications. It is intended for integrating ferry route information and booking flows into MCP clients (such as AI assistants or tools that support MCP).

## Features
- **MCP-compatible server**: Implements an MCP server interface so it can be plugged into MCP-capable applications and agents.
- **Ferry travel data access**: Exposes ferry travel–related information (e.g., routes, schedules, operators, destinations) for use within MCP clients.
- **Booking-related actions**: Provides endpoints or tools to perform booking-related operations (such as searching availability, initiating bookings, or managing ferry trips) from within an MCP environment.
- **Open server**: Designed as an open MCP server implementation, allowing broader integration and reuse.
