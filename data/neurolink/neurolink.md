**Vendor/Brand:** juspay

## Overview
Neurolink is an edge‑first AI infrastructure platform that unifies multiple AI providers and models behind a single interface. It exposes these capabilities via an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server so that agents and tools can access enterprise AI services in a standardized way. It also includes a professional CLI and tooling for building, testing, and deploying AI applications across providers.

## Features
- **Edge‑first AI infrastructure**
  - Designed to run AI workloads close to the edge for low latency and improved performance.

- **Unified multi‑provider AI access**
  - Integrates multiple AI providers and models under one platform.
  - Provides a common abstraction layer so applications don’t need to manage each provider separately.

- **MCP server integration**
  - Exposes AI capabilities via an MCP server.
  - Allows AI agents and tools that support MCP to access Neurolink in a consistent, standardized way.
  - Includes example MCP configuration files (e.g., `.mcp-config.json`, `.mcp-servers.example.json`).

- **Universal AI development platform**
  - Supports building, testing, and deploying AI applications from a single toolkit.
  - Aims to work with multiple AI providers without rewriting core application logic.

- **CLI and tooling**
  - Professional CLI for managing configuration, development, and deployment flows.
  - Project structure with `scripts`, `tools`, and `config` directories for automation and environment management.

- **Examples and demos**
  - `examples` directory with sample projects and usage patterns.
  - `neurolink-demo` for demonstrating typical integration and workflows.

- **Memory and state handling**
  - `memory-bank` module suggesting support for managing AI memory or long‑term context for agents.

- **Configuration & environment management**
  - Sample environment files (`.env.example`, `.env.test`) for setting up credentials and runtime configuration.
  - Git leak configuration (`.gitleaksrc.json`) to help avoid committing secrets.

- **Testing & documentation**
  - `test` directory for automated tests.
  - `docs` directory for platform documentation and usage guides.
