## Description
Gender API MCP Server is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration that connects applications to the Gender API service. It lets MCP-based workflows infer or look up customer gender from names so registration flows can remain simple while still enabling downstream analytics and data enrichment.

## Features
- **MCP server endpoint**: Uses a single static MCP server URL for all compatible clients: `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`.
- **Gender determination from names**: Integrates with Gender API so workflows can determine customer gender from provided names.
- **Workflow integration**: Designed for use inside MCP-aware chat clients and tools, enabling automated data enrichment in registration and analytics flows.
- **Simple registration optimization**: Allows forms to remain minimal while capturing gender-related insights programmatically.
- **Client-agnostic configuration**: The same MCP server URL works across different MCP-compatible chat clients; authentication is handled when adding the server to each application.
- **Configuration guidance**: Supports step-by-step setup via a central configuration page for adding the server to various clients.

## Technical Details
