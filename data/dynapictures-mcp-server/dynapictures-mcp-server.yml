  ## Description

  DynaPictures MCP Server is an MCP-compatible integration that connects MCP
  clients to DynaPictures’ cloud-based image generation API. It enables dynamic,
  personalized image creation at scale, allowing you to generate large volumes
  of customized images (e.g., with names, coupons, or other variable data) from
  connected data sources.


  ## Features

  - **MCP server endpoint**: Single static MCP server URL
  (`https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`) usable across compatible MCP clients.

  - **MCP client integration**: Designed to be added as a server in MCP-capable
  chat or automation clients.

  - **Cloud-based image generation**: Uses DynaPictures’ cloud API to generate
  images dynamically.

  - **Personalization at scale**: Supports generating hundreds of personalized
  images in minutes.

  - **Dynamic content insertion**: Can render client names, coupons, and other
  arbitrary text or data into image templates.

  - **Data source connectivity (via DynaPictures)**: Connects to external data
  sources such as Google Sheets to drive image personalization.

  - **Centralized configuration**: Works with a common Pipedream MCP
  configuration flow and documentation.


  ## Integration & Usage

  - Use the static MCP server URL in your MCP-compatible application.

  - Authenticate when adding the server in your client (per client-specific
  setup instructions).

  - Drive image generation via DynaPictures templates and connected data sources
  (e.g., spreadsheets).
