## Overview
Persona MCP Server connects MCP-compatible tools to Persona’s identity infrastructure, enabling automated and customizable identity verification workflows directly from your chat or MCP client.

## Features
- **MCP-compatible identity integration**: Exposes Persona’s identity infrastructure through the Model Context Protocol (MCP) so agents and tools can interact with Persona programmatically.
- **Automated verification workflows**: Supports building automated identity verification flows leveraging Persona’s backend services.
- **Customizable verification solutions**: Designed to let you craft personalized verification logic and flows tailored to your application’s requirements.
- **Static MCP server endpoint**: Uses a single static URL that works for all clients:
  - MCP server URL: `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`
- **Per-client authentication**: Authentication is performed when you add the server to your application / client, allowing secure, client-specific access.
- **Multi-client support**: Intended to be added to various chat clients or MCP-enabled applications for unified identity verification capabilities.
- **Configuration guidance**: A separate configuration page is available (via the host platform) to help with setup and connection details.
