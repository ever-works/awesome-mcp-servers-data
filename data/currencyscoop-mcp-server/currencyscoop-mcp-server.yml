  # CurrencyScoop MCP Server


  **Category:** Finance / Market Data MCP Servers  

  **Brand:** CurrencyBeacon  

  **Slug:** currencyscoop-mcp-server


  ## Description

  The CurrencyScoop MCP Server is an MCP-compatible service that connects to the
  CurrencyBeacon/CurrencyScoop REST API to provide real-time and historical
  foreign exchange (FX) and cryptocurrency rates to MCP clients through a
  standardized server interface.


  ## Features

  - **MCP-compatible server**: Exposes CurrencyBeacon/CurrencyScoop data via a
  standardized Model Context Protocol (MCP) server interface for use in
  compatible chat or AI clients.

  - **Real-time exchange rates**: Access up-to-date FX rates for fiat currencies
  and cryptocurrencies.

  - **Historical exchange rates**: Retrieve past FX and crypto rates for
  historical or analytical use cases.

  - **Fiat and crypto coverage**: Supports both traditional (fiat) currency
  pairs and cryptocurrencies.

  - **Static MCP endpoint**: Uses a single static MCP server URL for all
  clients:
    - `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`
  - **Application-level authentication**: Authentication is handled when
  adding/configuring the server in your application rather than changing the
  server URL.

  - **Client-agnostic setup**: Can be added to different MCP-compatible chat
  clients using the same server URL.


  ## Integration & Usage

  - Add the MCP server using the static URL `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2` in
  your MCP-compatible client.

  - Configure authentication and any client-specific settings within your
  application.

  - Detailed setup instructions are available via the provider’s configuration
  documentation.
