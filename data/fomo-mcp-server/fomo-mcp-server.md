## Overview
Fomo MCP Server is an integration that connects the Fomo social proof platform with MCP-compatible applications. It allows these applications to surface Fomo social proof events (such as recent purchases or signups) to help drive website conversion.

## Features
- **MCP integration for Fomo:** Exposes Fomo’s social proof capabilities through the MCP protocol so MCP-compatible apps can interact with Fomo data.
- **Static MCP server endpoint:** Uses a single static server URL (`https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`) that works for all clients.
- **Account-based authentication:** Authentication occurs when adding the MCP server to an application, after which it can access the connected Fomo account.
- **Client-agnostic setup:** Designed to be added to various MCP-compatible chat or automation clients; setup guidance is available per client type.
- **Configuration via Pipedream:** Fomo configuration and connection are managed through Pipedream’s interface, where you connect your Fomo account and select a client.

## Use Cases
- Displaying real-time social proof notifications (e.g., purchases, signups) inside tools or workflows that speak MCP.
- Integrating Fomo conversion signals into MCP-based assistants or interfaces that help optimize website engagement.
