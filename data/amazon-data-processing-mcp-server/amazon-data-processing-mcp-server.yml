  # Amazon Data Processing MCP Server


  ## Overview

  The Amazon Data Processing MCP Server is an MCP-compatible server that exposes
  tools for orchestrating and monitoring AWS data processing workloads. It
  focuses on providing comprehensive data processing capabilities and real-time
  visibility into pipelines running on AWS Glue and Amazon EMR on EC2, so
  MCP-based agents can manage, observe, and interact with AWS data pipelines
  programmatically.


  - **Vendor / Brand:** Amazon Web Services (AWS)

  - **Category:** Cloud & DevOps MCP Servers

  - **Primary use cases:** Data pipeline orchestration, monitoring, and
  troubleshooting across AWS Glue and Amazon EMR-EC2 from MCP-based agents.


  ## Features


  ### AWS Glue Integration

  - Orchestrate AWS Glue data processing jobs via MCP tools.

  - Monitor Glue jobs and pipelines, enabling real-time visibility into
  execution status.

  - Allow MCP-based agents to trigger, inspect, and manage Glue-based ETL/ELT
  workflows.


  ### Amazon EMR on EC2 Integration

  - Interact with Amazon EMR clusters running on EC2.

  - Enable MCP agents to orchestrate EMR-based data processing pipelines.

  - Provide real-time visibility into EMR job and pipeline execution states.


  ### Pipeline Orchestration & Control

  - Centralized orchestration of heterogeneous data processing pipelines
  spanning Glue and EMR-EC2.

  - Tools suitable for coordinating multi-step workflows handled by MCP-based
  agents.


  ### Real-Time Observability

  - Real-time pipeline visibility across AWS Glue and Amazon EMR-EC2.

  - Access to status and metadata that allow agents to monitor health and
  progress of data workflows.


  ### MCP-Based Agent Enablement

  - Exposes data processing and monitoring capabilities as MCP tools.

  - Designed so LLM/MCP agents can:
    - Discover available pipelines/jobs.
    - Start/stop or manage jobs.
    - Inspect current run states and histories.

  ## Pricing

  No pricing information is provided in the available content. The server
  appears to be an AWS Labs MCP server; costs, if any, would typically relate to
  underlying AWS services used (e.g., AWS Glue, Amazon EMR on EC2), but specific
  pricing details are not listed here.
