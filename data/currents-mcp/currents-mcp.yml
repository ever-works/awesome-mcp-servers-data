  ## Description

  Currents MCP Server is a tool that enables integration between Playwright test
  results (as reported to Currents) and AI agents, allowing AI to analyze, fix,
  or optimize tests that are failing in CI/CD pipelines. It provides a server
  interface for relaying test context and results to AI-powered tools and
  workflows.


  ## Features

  - **MCP Server:** Acts as a middleman between Currents (test management) and
  AI agents, enabling automated handling of test failures.

  - **Test Context Provisioning:** Supplies AI agents with detailed context
  about test failures from Playwright runs in CI/CD environments.

  - **API Integration:** Provides endpoints to:
      - Retrieve API configuration (API key and URL for Currents API)
      - Get run information by run ID
      - Get spec file attempts and error details by instance ID
  - **Multiple Editor Support:** Can be configured for use with both Cursor
  Editor and Claude Desktop, making it flexible for different developer
  environments.

  - **Easy Setup:** Uses `npx` for straightforward installation and execution,
  with configuration via JSON files.

  - **Open Source:** Source code available for customization and contributions.
