  ### Overview

  CodeGraphContext is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that indexes local
  code into a graph database. It exposes structured code context to AI
  assistants to enable graph-based exploration and reasoning over codebases.


  ### Features

  - **MCP server integration**
    - Implements an MCP server interface for connecting to AI assistants and coding agents.
    - Provides programmatic access to indexed code structure via the MCP protocol.

  - **Local code indexing**
    - Scans and indexes local code repositories.
    - Builds a structured representation of code elements for later querying.

  - **Graph database backend**
    - Stores code entities and relationships in a graph database.
    - Enables graph-style traversal of code (e.g., dependencies, references, relationships between symbols).

  - **Structured code context for AI**
    - Exposes code structure, relationships, and context as data that AI assistants can consume.
    - Designed to support code understanding, navigation, and reasoning tasks for coding agents.

  - **Graph-based code exploration**
    - Allows exploration of codebases through graph queries.
    - Supports reasoning over connections between files, functions, and other code entities.

  - **Repository structure**
    - `src/codegraphcontext`: Core MCP server implementation and logic.
    - `docs`: Documentation and reference material.
    - `tests`: Automated tests for the project.
    - `scripts`: Helper/utility scripts for development or operations.
    - `organizer`: Project organization or configuration resources.
    - `website`: Source for the accompanying project website.
    - `images`: Assets used in documentation/website.
