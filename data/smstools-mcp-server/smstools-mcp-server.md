# SMSTools MCP Server

## Overview
SMSTools MCP Server connects MCP-compatible clients to SMSTools, a low‑cost bulk SMS text message marketing platform. It allows applications and chat-based tools to interact with SMSTools through the standard MCP server endpoint.

## Features
- **MCP-compatible server** for integrating SMSTools with any MCP client.
- **Static MCP endpoint** usable across clients: `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`.
- **Authentication at client setup**: you authenticate when adding the server to your application, so the same URL works for all clients.
- **Bulk SMS marketing support** via the underlying SMSTools platform (for sending and managing text message campaigns).

## How It Works
1. Use the static MCP server URL: `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`.
2. Add the server to your MCP-compatible chat client or application.
3. Authenticate within your client when prompted.
4. Interact with SMSTools features (e.g., bulk SMS marketing) via MCP tools exposed by the server.
