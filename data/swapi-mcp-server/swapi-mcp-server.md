**Category:** Data Access & Integration MCP Servers  
**Brand:** swapi  
**Source:** https://mcp.pipedream.com/app/swapi  
**MCP Server URL:** `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`

## Description
The SWAPI MCP Server provides MCP-compatible access to the Star Wars API (SWAPI), exposing structured data from the Star Wars universe (such as films, people, starships, and related entities) to MCP-enabled clients via a static endpoint.

## Features
- **MCP-compatible server**: Implements the Model Context Protocol (MCP) so it can be added as a server to MCP-compatible chat or agent clients.
- **Static server URL**: Uses a single, static endpoint (`https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`) that works across clients.
- **Authentication at client setup**: Authentication is handled when adding the server to your application, not by changing the URL.
- **Star Wars universe data access**: Connects to SWAPI to expose data including (but not limited to):
  - Films
  - People/characters
  - Starships
  - (And other standard SWAPI resources such as planets, vehicles, species, etc., as supported by SWAPI)
- **API integration**: Acts as a bridge between MCP clients and the SWAPI HTTP API so you can query Star Wars data programmatically from within MCP-aware tools.
- **Client-agnostic configuration**: The same base URL is used for all supported chat/agent clients; configuration details are handled per client.
