**Brand:** Pipedream  
**Slug:** jenkins-mcp-server

## Overview
Jenkins MCP Server is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server integration for Jenkins, enabling automation of build, deployment, and CI/CD workflows by connecting Jenkins to Pipedream-powered applications and chat clients via a single static endpoint.

## MCP Server URL
```text
https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2
```
This static URL is used to add the Jenkins MCP Server to any compatible client. Authentication is handled when you add the server to your application.

## Features
- **Jenkins Integration**: Connects Jenkins, a leading open-source automation server, into MCP-compatible tools.
- **CI/CD Workflow Automation**: Enables automation of build, deployment, and broader CI/CD workflows through Jenkins.
- **Plugin Ecosystem Access**: Leverages Jenkins’ extensive plugin ecosystem to support building, deploying, and automating many types of projects.
- **Static MCP Endpoint**: Uses a single, static MCP server URL (`https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`) for all supported clients.
- **Client-Agnostic**: Designed to work with multiple chat or MCP clients; configuration is done on the client side using the same server URL.
- **Pipedream Connect Integration**: Runs on top of Pipedream Connect infrastructure for integrating Jenkins into broader automation flows.

## Usage
- Add the MCP server to your preferred MCP-compatible or chat client using the static URL.
- Authenticate within the client when prompted during server setup.
- Configure Jenkins-related actions and workflows in line with your client’s MCP configuration options.
