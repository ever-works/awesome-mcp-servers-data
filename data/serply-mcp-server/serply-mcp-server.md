## Overview
Serply MCP Server is an MCP-compatible service that provides accurate, real-time Google search and SERP (Search Engine Results Page) data as JSON. It is designed as a lightweight alternative to traditional SERP APIs, exposing search results through a minimal interface suitable for MCP-enabled clients.

## Features
- **Real-time Google Search Results**: Retrieve up-to-date Google search results programmatically.
- **SERP Data as JSON**: Returns structured SERP information in JSON format for easy parsing and integration.
- **Lightweight Interface**: Designed with less bloat compared to many traditional SERP APIs, focusing on essential search and SERP functionality.
- **Static MCP Server URL**: Uses a single static endpoint for all MCP clients:
  - `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`
- **Client-agnostic Configuration**: Same server URL works across different MCP-compatible chat or agent clients; authentication is handled when adding the server to each application.
- **Pipedream Connect Integration**: Operates via Pipedream Connect infrastructure, making it straightforward to plug into workflows or tools that support MCP.

## Usage & Integration
