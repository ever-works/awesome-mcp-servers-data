  # Serply MCP Server


  **Category:** Web Search MCP Servers  

  **Brand:** Serply  

  **Source:** https://mcp.pipedream.com/app/serply


  ## Overview

  Serply MCP Server is an MCP-compatible service that provides accurate,
  real-time Google search and SERP (Search Engine Results Page) data as JSON. It
  is designed as a lightweight alternative to traditional SERP APIs, exposing
  search results through a minimal interface suitable for MCP-enabled clients.


  ## Features

  - **Real-time Google Search Results**: Retrieve up-to-date Google search
  results programmatically.

  - **SERP Data as JSON**: Returns structured SERP information in JSON format
  for easy parsing and integration.

  - **Lightweight Interface**: Designed with less bloat compared to many
  traditional SERP APIs, focusing on essential search and SERP functionality.

  - **Static MCP Server URL**: Uses a single static endpoint for all MCP
  clients:
    - `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`
  - **Client-agnostic Configuration**: Same server URL works across different
  MCP-compatible chat or agent clients; authentication is handled when adding
  the server to each application.

  - **Pipedream Connect Integration**: Operates via Pipedream Connect
  infrastructure, making it straightforward to plug into workflows or tools that
  support MCP.


  ## Usage & Integration

  - Add the MCP server using the static URL `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2` in
  any compatible client.

  - Authenticate within your chosen client or application during setup.
