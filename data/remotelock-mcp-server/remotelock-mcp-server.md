## Overview
RemoteLock MCP Server is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration that exposes RemoteLock’s WiFi smart lock platform to AI agents. It enables applications and agents to interact with access control and smart locks used in businesses and rental properties via a standardized MCP interface.

## Features
- **MCP Integration for RemoteLock**: Provides an MCP-compliant server that connects AI agents to RemoteLock’s WiFi smart lock platform.
- **Access Control for Business and Rentals**: Designed for use cases involving commercial properties and rental accommodations, where centralized access management is required.
- **Static MCP Server URL**: Uses a single static endpoint that works across compatible MCP clients:
  - Server URL: `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`
- **Client-Agnostic Setup**: The same server URL is used for every supported chat or agent client; configuration is handled per client.
- **Authentication on Add**: Authentication occurs when the server is added to an application or client, allowing secure access to the underlying RemoteLock smart lock and access control capabilities.

> Note: The underlying page does not list finer-grained operations (e.g., lock/unlock, code management), but the MCP server is intended to expose RemoteLock’s smart lock and access control functionality to AI agents.
