## Description
The Google Marketplace MCP Server is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server integration that connects MCP-based workflows with third-party applications available in the Google Workspace Marketplace. It allows compatible clients (such as chat-based or automation tools that support MCP) to interact with apps in the Google Workspace ecosystem through a common server endpoint.

## Features
- **MCP server for Google Workspace Marketplace** – Exposes Google Workspace Marketplace–integrated apps to MCP-compatible clients.
- **Static server endpoint** – Uses a single static MCP server URL for all clients: `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`.
- **Per-client authentication** – Authentication is handled when adding the MCP server to each application/client, rather than changing the server URL.
- **Multi-client compatibility** – Can be added to different supported chat or MCP clients, each with its own connection instructions.
- **Centralized configuration** – Configuration details and additional setup options are available via a dedicated configuration page on Pipedream.

## How It Works
1. Connect your Google Workspace Marketplace account in Pipedream.
2. Copy the static MCP server URL: `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`.
3. Add this MCP server to your MCP-compatible app or chat client.
4. Authenticate within that client to begin using Marketplace-integrated tools.
