## Overview
MSSQL MCP Server (by JexinSam) is a Python-based Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that connects Large Language Model (LLM) clients to Microsoft SQL Server databases. It provides an MCP-compliant interface so LLMs can query and work with MSSQL databases in a structured, programmatic way.

## Features
- **MCP-compatible server** for integrating MSSQL with tools and agents that speak the Model Context Protocol.
- **Python-based implementation**, suitable for extension or customization in Python environments.
- **Microsoft SQL Server integration**, enabling LLMs to:
  - Run queries against MSSQL databases.
  - Interact with data through the MCP abstraction layer.
- **Secure interaction focus**, designed to facilitate controlled access to MSSQL databases rather than direct, unmediated connections.
- **Open-source repository** with version control, tags, and tests, allowing inspection, auditing, and contribution.

## Pricing
- **Free & Open Source** – distributed under the MIT License; no usage fee.
