## Overview
Context7 MCP Server is a remote Model Context Protocol (MCP) server accessible over HTTP at `https://mcp.context7.com/mcp`. It is designed to be used from VS Code and other MCP-compatible clients as a network-accessible MCP endpoint, rather than a local stdio-based process. It focuses on providing up‑to‑date code documentation and related context for LLMs and AI code editors.

## Features
- **Remote MCP over HTTP**  
  - Exposes MCP tools and context via an HTTP endpoint (`https://mcp.context7.com/mcp`).  
  - Operates as a network-accessible service instead of a local stdio server.

- **MCP Compatibility**  
  - Implements the Model Context Protocol to integrate with MCP-aware clients.  
  - Intended for use in VS Code and compatible MCP clients/editors.

- **Code Documentation Context**  
  - Provides up‑to‑date code documentation context for LLMs.  
  - Tailored for AI code editors and coding assistants that need current documentation data.

- **Remote Execution & AI Integration**  
  - Designed for remote-execution workflows where tools are accessed over the network.  
  - Supports AI integration scenarios that rely on MCP tools and contextual data.

- **Tag-based Capabilities**  
  - `remote-execution`: optimized for running tools and accessing context remotely.  
  - `ai-integration`: built to plug into AI-driven development and editing workflows.  
  - `http`: communicates using HTTP as the transport layer.
