# Koyeb MCP Server

Cloud-based application deployment platform integration for Koyeb via MCP.

## Overview
The Koyeb MCP Server is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server integration that connects MCP-compatible clients to Koyeb’s cloud-based application deployment platform. It is provided via Pipedream Connect and exposes a static MCP endpoint usable from any supported client.

## Features
- **MCP integration endpoint**: Static MCP server URL that can be used with any compatible client:
  - `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`
- **Client-agnostic usage**: The same MCP server URL works across different chat or MCP-enabled clients.
- **Authentication during setup**: Authentication occurs when adding the server to your application, rather than requiring a per-client URL.
- **Pipedream Connect integration**: Provided and hosted through Pipedream’s Connect infrastructure.
- **Configuration guidance**: Dedicated configuration documentation available via a central configuration page (for step-by-step setup per client).

## Usage
1. Copy the MCP server URL: `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`.
2. Add this server to your MCP-enabled app or chat client.
3. Follow client-specific instructions on the configuration page for full setup and authentication.
