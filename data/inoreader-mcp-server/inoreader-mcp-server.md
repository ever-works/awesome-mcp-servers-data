## Overview
The Inoreader MCP Server is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration that connects Inoreader with AI-driven agents and chat clients. It allows applications to build and consume personalized newsfeeds using Inoreader data through a standardized MCP server endpoint.

## Features
- **MCP-compatible server** for integrating Inoreader with AI agents and chat applications.
- **Static server endpoint** for all compatible clients: `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`.
- **Account-based configuration**: connect your Inoreader account before using the tools.
- **Client-agnostic setup**: works with multiple MCP-enabled chat clients; you select your client and follow the provided setup steps.
- **Application-level authentication**: authentication occurs when adding the server to your application rather than per-client URL.
- **Tool discovery**: exposes “available tools” (MCP actions) for working with feeds and content, which are dynamically loaded by the client.
- **Configuration documentation**: a dedicated configuration page explains how to add and use the server with different clients.
