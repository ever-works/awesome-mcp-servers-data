## Overview
Looker MCP Server is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server integration that exposes Looker’s business intelligence capabilities and data models to MCP-compatible agents and applications. It enables BI-driven insights and reporting to be used directly within MCP-aware tools and chat clients.

## Features
- **MCP-compatible BI integration**: Connects Looker’s business intelligence environment to any MCP-compatible client or application.
- **Access to Looker data models**: Exposes Looker’s modeled data for querying, analysis, and reporting from MCP agents.
- **Static MCP server URL**: Uses a single, static endpoint for all clients:
  - `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`
- **Client-agnostic setup**: The same server URL works across different chat clients and applications that support MCP.
- **Authentication at client level**: Authentication is handled when adding the server to each specific application or client (per-client auth flow).
- **Configuration documentation**: Supplementary configuration guidance is available via the platform’s Configuration page (for setup details and client-specific instructions).

## Usage

2. Add this MCP server endpoint to your MCP-compatible chat client or application.
