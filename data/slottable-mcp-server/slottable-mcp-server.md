# Slottable MCP Server

**Category:** Business & Commerce MCP Servers  
**Brand:** slottable  
**Slug:** `slottable-mcp-server`

## Overview
Slottable MCP Server integrates Slottable’s slot and capacity booking system into the Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing AI-powered tools and chat clients to share, book, and manage limited seats, tickets, or other capacity-based resources (“slots”).

## Features
- **MCP Integration**: Exposes Slottable’s booking and capacity system through an MCP server, so MCP-compatible clients can interact with slots programmatically.
- **Slot-Based Resources**: Designed for anything with limited “seats,” “tickets,” “spots,” or similar capacity-constrained resources.
- **Booking & Scheduling**: Supports workflows to share available slots, book them, and manage reservations via AI or other MCP-aware tools.
- **Capacity Management**: Intended for managing availability and capacity of resources that have a fixed number of slots.
- **Static MCP Endpoint**: Uses a single static MCP server URL that works across clients: `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`.
- **Client-Agnostic Setup**: Can be added to different chat clients or MCP-compatible applications using the same server URL, with authentication handled when configuring the server in the client.

## Technical Details
