  # WhoisFreaks MCP Server


  **Category:** Search & Discovery MCP Servers  

  **Brand:** WhoisFreaks  

  **Slug:** `whoisfreaks-mcp-server`


  ## Description

  The WhoisFreaks MCP Server is a model context protocol (MCP) server that
  allows AI agents and chat-based applications to query domain WHOIS data and
  related domain intelligence using the WhoisFreaks API. It is provided via
  Pipedream Connect and exposes a static MCP endpoint that can be integrated
  with compatible clients.


  ## Features

  - **WHOIS data access**: Enables querying of domain WHOIS records via the
  WhoisFreaks API.

  - **Domain intelligence**: Provides access to related domain intelligence data
  (e.g., metadata associated with domain ownership and registration), as
  supported by the WhoisFreaks API.

  - **MCP-compatible server**: Implements the Model Context Protocol so that AI
  agents and MCP-capable chat clients can consume WhoisFreaks data.

  - **Static server URL**: Uses a single static MCP endpoint that works across
  supported clients:  
    - MCP server URL: `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`
  - **Client-agnostic setup**: Designed to be added to various MCP-compatible
  chat clients; configuration is handled at the client level.

  - **Authentication via client**: Authentication to WhoisFreaks is performed
  when adding/configuring the server within your application or client
  (credentials not hard-coded in the URL).

  - **Hosted by Pipedream Connect**: The MCP server is run and delivered through
  Pipedream’s infrastructure.


  ## Integration & Usage

  - **Add to your app**: Configure the MCP server URL
  (`https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`) in your MCP-enabled chat client or
  application.

  - **Configuration reference**: Detailed setup and configuration options are
  available on the provider’s Configuration page (linked from the product page).
