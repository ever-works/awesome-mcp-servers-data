  ## Features


  - **MCP-compatible endpoint**  
    - Static MCP server URL: `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`  
    - Works with any compatible MCP client / chat application.

  - **Programmatic domain management**  
    - Designed to enable operations on Namecheap-registered domains (e.g., registration lifecycle, configuration, and updates) via MCP-aware tools.

  - **DNS management integration**  
    - Intended for managing DNS records associated with Namecheap domains (create, update, delete, and query DNS settings) through MCP clients.

  - **Hosting-related controls**  
    - Supports interaction with Namecheap hosting–related features where exposed through Namecheap’s APIs (e.g., configuration and management of domain/hosting linkage).

  - **Authentication at client setup**  
    - The URL is static; authentication occurs when adding the server to an application or chat client.

  - **Tooling and agent integration**  
    - Built to be used by MCP-aware tools, agents, and chat clients so they can call Namecheap operations as part of automated workflows.

  - **Configuration documentation**  
    - Compatible with generic MCP configuration flows; full configuration details are available via the platform’s configuration documentation (referenced as a “Configuration page”).
