  ## Overview

  Crawlbase MCP Server is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server integration
  that connects MCP-compatible agents and chat clients to Crawlbase’s web
  crawling, scraping, and proxy capabilities through Pipedream. It provides a
  static MCP endpoint that applications can register to gain programmatic access
  to Crawlbase’s data crawling infrastructure.


  ## Features

  - **MCP-compatible server endpoint**  
    - Provides a single static MCP server URL: `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`  
    - Can be added to any supported MCP chat client or application.

  - **Integration with Crawlbase platform**  
    - Connects to a Crawlbase account via Pipedream configuration.  
    - Exposes Crawlbase’s crawling, scraping, and proxy features to MCP-compatible agents.

  - **Client-agnostic setup**  
    - Same server URL works across different MCP clients.  
    - Authentication handled when adding the server to the client or app.

  - **Configurable via Pipedream UI**  
    - "Configure Crawlbase" flow to connect your Crawlbase account.  
    - Client selection to view specific setup instructions.  
    - Link to a full configuration page for detailed setup steps.

  - **Tool-based access**  
    - Exposes "Available tools" (actions) to the connected MCP client (details are loaded dynamically in the UI).  
    - Designed for programmatic use in data analytics and automation flows.

  ## Usage

  1. Connect your Crawlbase account in the Pipedream "Configure Crawlbase"
  screen.  

  2. Copy the MCP server URL: `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`.  

  3. Add this server URL to your MCP-compatible chat client or application.  

  4. Authenticate when prompted in the client.
