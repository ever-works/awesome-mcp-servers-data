  # Amazon Aurora MySQL MCP Server


  ## Overview

  The **Amazon Aurora MySQL MCP Server** is an MCP (Model Context Protocol)
  server that exposes **Amazon Aurora MySQL** database operations through the
  **AWS RDS Data API**. It enables MCP-compatible AI agents and tools to query
  and manage Aurora MySQL instances programmatically, integrating database
  access into AI-driven workflows and applications.


  - **Category:** Database & Messaging MCP Servers  

  - **Ecosystem:** Amazon Web Services (AWS), Aurora MySQL, RDS Data API  

  - **Intended use:** Let LLM-based agents interact with Aurora MySQL for
  querying, data access, and database management via MCP.


  ## Features


  ### MCP Integration

  - Implements the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** to allow LLMs and AI agents
  to interact with Aurora MySQL.

  - Exposes database operations as MCP tools/endpoints that can be invoked from
  MCP-compatible clients.

  - Designed to provide structured, contextual data back to AI models for more
  accurate, context-aware responses.


  ### Aurora MySQL via RDS Data API

  - Connects to **Amazon Aurora MySQL** using the **AWS RDS Data API** (no
  direct database connection from the client required).

  - Supports operations that are typically exposed via the RDS Data API (e.g.,
  executing SQL statements against Aurora MySQL).

  - Leverages AWS-managed connectivity, authentication, and scaling provided by
  RDS Data API.


  ### AI & Workflow Enablement

  - Allows AI agents to **query and manage** Aurora MySQL instances as part of
  automated workflows.

  - Reduces the need for custom glue code between LLMs and Aurora MySQL by
  standardizing access through MCP.

  - Designed to improve output quality from AI systems by giving them direct,
  structured access to live database data.


  ### AWS & UBOS Ecosystem Alignment

  - Built to operate within the **UBOS Asset Marketplace** of MCP servers,
  alongside other AWS-focused MCP assets.

  - Intended for cloud-native and AI-assisted development scenarios using AWS
  infrastructure.
