## Overview

octocode-mcp is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides semantic code research and context generation in real time using LLM patterns. It enables natural-language search and exploration across public and private repositories (respecting user permissions) and converts accessible codebases into AI-optimized knowledge for understanding simple and complex code flows.

## Features

- **MCP Server Integration**  
  - Exposes functionality as an MCP server for use with MCP-compatible coding agents and tooling.

- **Semantic Code Research**  
  - Performs semantic (meaning-based) search over code rather than simple text matching.  
  - Supports discovery of real implementations and examples within codebases.

- **Real-time Context Generation**  
  - Generates code context on the fly using LLM patterns.  
  - Helps produce AI-optimized knowledge from existing repositories.

- **Natural Language Search**  
  - Allows users to search codebases using natural language queries.  
  - Works across both public and private repositories, constrained by the user’s access permissions.

- **Multi-Repository / Ecosystem Coverage**  
  - Designed for research, analysis, and discovery across GitHub and npm ecosystems (as per project description).  
  - Can transform any accessible codebase(s) into structured, queryable knowledge.

- **Documentation & Config Files**  
  - Includes docs and configuration (ESLint, Prettier, Yarn, etc.) for development and contribution within the repo.
