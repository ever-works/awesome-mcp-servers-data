# timelink MCP Server

**Category:** Business & Commerce · MCP Servers  
**Brand:** Pipedream  
**Website:** https://mcp.pipedream.com/app/timelink

## Overview
The timelink MCP Server exposes timelink’s time tracking platform through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing compatible chat or agent clients to interact with timelink for time-tracking, productivity, and billing workflows.

## Features
- **MCP-compatible server**: Connects timelink’s time tracking platform to any MCP-capable client.
- **Static server URL**: Single MCP endpoint for all clients:
  - `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`
- **Client-agnostic configuration**: Works with multiple chat/agent clients that support MCP; configuration is handled when adding the server to the application.
- **Authentication at connection time**: Users authenticate when adding the MCP server to their app, rather than using client-specific URLs.
- **Integration via Pipedream Connect**: Runs on Pipedream’s infrastructure, enabling streamlined integration with other tools and workflows.
- **Use cases** (implied from platform focus):
  - Time tracking for individuals or teams
  - Productivity monitoring and reporting
  - Tracking time for billing and invoicing workflows

## Setup
- Use the static MCP server URL: `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2` when configuring your MCP client.
- Follow client-specific instructions from the configuration documentation (linked from the app page) to add the server and complete authentication.
