  ## Overview

  BunnyCDN MCP Server is an integration that connects BunnyCDN’s content
  delivery network services to MCP-compatible clients and workflows. It allows
  you to manage and interact with BunnyCDN infrastructure through a unified MCP
  endpoint.


  ## Features

  - Uses a single static MCP server URL for all supported clients:
  `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`.

  - Supports authentication when adding the MCP server to your application
  (authentication handled at client setup time).

  - Allows configuration of BunnyCDN by connecting your BunnyCDN account via the
  MCP server.

  - Designed to work across multiple chat or MCP clients (selection and setup
  per client).

  - Centralized configuration and management through the Pipedream configuration
  page.


  ## MCP Server Endpoint

  - **Server URL:** `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`  
    This URL is reused across clients; authentication and specific tool access are handled after adding it to your app.

  ## Setup Notes

  authentication.
