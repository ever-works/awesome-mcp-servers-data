## Overview

Google Compute Engine MCP Server is an integration layer that exposes Google Compute Engine (GCE) resources to AI agents via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It allows programmatic management and interaction with virtual machine instances and related GCE infrastructure through a standardized, tool-like interface.

## Features

- **MCP-based access to GCE**  
  Provides a Model Context Protocol server implementation that lets compatible AI agents discover and use GCE operations as tools.

- **Virtual machine instance management**  
  Designed to interact with Google Compute Engine VM instances (e.g., list, inspect, and manage instances programmatically).

- **Infrastructure-focused operations**  
  Targets broader GCE infrastructure resources beyond VMs, enabling AI-driven workflows around cloud infrastructure management.

- **Programmatic, automated control**  
  Intended for scripted and agent-driven control flows rather than manual console use, enabling automations such as provisioning, updating, or interrogating resources.

- **Google Cloud ecosystem alignment**  
  Built specifically for Google Compute Engine and fits into Google’s broader cloud and AI tooling ecosystem.

## Use Cases

- Letting AI agents query and manage GCE virtual machines as part of development, operations, or automation workflows.
- Building infrastructure automation that routes all GCE interactions through a consistent MCP tool interface.
- Experimenting with AI-assisted cloud operations where an agent can observe and act on cloud resources under policy.

## Pricing
