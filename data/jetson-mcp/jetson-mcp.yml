  - Can be run as a background service managed by systemd for reliability

  - Supports manual running for testing and development

  - Provides tools for retrieving hardware and software information from the
  Jetson device

  - Network-based communication over configurable port (default 8000)

  - Includes installation and setup scripts for ease of deployment

  - Supports firewall configuration guidance for network access


  ## Installation

  - Recommended to run as a systemd service on the Jetson device

  - Includes setup scripts for creating and enabling the service

  - Instructions provided for finding device IP/hostname and configuring
  firewall rules
