- **Build automation** for AWS serverless applications (e.g., packaging and preparing functions and resources)
- **Deployment workflows** to provision and update serverless stacks on AWS
- **Operations support** for deployed serverless applications via SAM CLI capabilities (such as updates, redeploys, and related operational commands)
- **MCP integration** so tools that speak the Model Context Protocol can interact with AWS serverless projects through this server
- **AWS-native tooling** built around the standard AWS SAM CLI, ensuring compatibility with existing SAM templates and workflows

## Use Cases
- Managing AWS Lambda–based applications and other serverless resources through an MCP client
- Automating build and deployment steps for serverless services using SAM
- Operating and iterating on serverless stacks in a consistent, protocol-based way
