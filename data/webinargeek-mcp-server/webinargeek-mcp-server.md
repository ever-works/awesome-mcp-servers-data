## Overview
WebinarGeek MCP Server is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that connects AI tools and chat clients to WebinarGeek. It enables automated control of webinar setup, registration, and engagement via WebinarGeek’s webinar platform. The server is delivered via Pipedream Connect.

The server is accessible through a static MCP endpoint URL and is added to compatible chat clients or applications, where you authenticate during setup.

## Features
- **MCP-based integration**: Provides a Model Context Protocol server endpoint that tools and chat clients can use to interact with WebinarGeek.
- **Static server URL**: Uses a single, static MCP URL for all clients:
  - `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`
- **Client-agnostic setup**: Can be added to different MCP-compatible chat clients; authentication occurs when you register the server in each client.
- **WebinarGeek platform integration**: Designed to let MCP tools control and automate workflows on WebinarGeek’s webinar platform (e.g., webinar setup, registration, and engagement actions).
- **Hosted by Pipedream Connect**: Operates as a managed MCP server provided through Pipedream’s infrastructure.
- **Configuration documentation**: A dedicated configuration page (on Pipedream) explains how to add and configure the server in supported clients.
