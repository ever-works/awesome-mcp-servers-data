## Overview
The SEEN MCP Server exposes SEEN’s personalized, data‑driven video capabilities through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing applications and chat clients to integrate video‑based communication workflows.

---

## Features
- **MCP-compatible server** – Implements a static MCP server endpoint that can be used from any compatible client.
- **Static server URL** – Single endpoint for all clients:  
  `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`
- **Client-agnostic setup** – Designed to work with multiple chat clients; configuration is handled per client when you add the server.
- **Authentication on connection** – Authentication occurs when the server is added to your application, rather than requiring a per-client URL.
- **Configuration documentation** – A dedicated configuration page (via Pipedream) explains how to connect and use the server with supported clients.
- **Pipedream integration** – Hosted and powered by Pipedream Connect, benefiting from Pipedream’s infrastructure and policies.
- **Use case focus** – Tailored for communication workflows that incorporate personalized, data-driven video content (e.g., marketing, customer communications).

## Usage
