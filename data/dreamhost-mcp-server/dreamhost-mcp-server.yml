  # Dreamhost MCP Server


  **Category:** Cloud & DevOps MCP Servers  

  **Brand:** DreamHost  

  **Slug:** `dreamhost-mcp-server`


  An MCP server integration that connects DreamHost hosting services with
  AI-powered developer tools, enabling programmatic interactions and automated
  workflows.


  ## Overview

  The Dreamhost MCP Server (via Pipedream) allows MCP-compatible clients to
  interact with a DreamHost account. This makes it possible to integrate
  DreamHost hosting operations into AI-assisted development environments and
  automation pipelines.


  ## Features

  - **MCP Server Integration**: Exposes DreamHost functionality through the
  Model Context Protocol (MCP) for standardized access from compatible clients.

  - **DreamHost Account Connectivity**: Connects to a DreamHost hosting account
  to perform actions programmatically (within the capabilities exposed by the
  integration).

  - **AI Tool Integration**: Designed to work with AI tools and IDEs such as:
    - Cursor
    - Claude
    - Windsurf
  - **Automation-Friendly**: Intended for use in automated workflows, allowing
  scripted or AI-directed hosting operations rather than manual dashboard use.

  - **Programmatic Hosting Management**: Enables interaction with DreamHost
  hosting services via code or AI agents instead of direct control panel usage.


  ## Use Cases

  - Integrating DreamHost management tasks into AI-assisted coding environments.

  - Automating common hosting operations as part of CI/CD or other DevOps
  workflows.

  - Allowing AI agents (via MCP clients) to interact with DreamHost resources as
  part of broader automation scenarios.
