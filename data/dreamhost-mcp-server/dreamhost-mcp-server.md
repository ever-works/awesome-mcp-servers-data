**Category:** Cloud & DevOps MCP Servers  
**Brand:** DreamHost  
**Slug:** `dreamhost-mcp-server`

An MCP server integration that connects DreamHost hosting services with AI-powered developer tools, enabling programmatic interactions and automated workflows.

## Overview
The Dreamhost MCP Server (via Pipedream) allows MCP-compatible clients to interact with a DreamHost account. This makes it possible to integrate DreamHost hosting operations into AI-assisted development environments and automation pipelines.

## Features
- **MCP Server Integration**: Exposes DreamHost functionality through the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for standardized access from compatible clients.
- **DreamHost Account Connectivity**: Connects to a DreamHost hosting account to perform actions programmatically (within the capabilities exposed by the integration).
- **AI Tool Integration**: Designed to work with AI tools and IDEs such as:
  - Cursor
  - Claude
  - Windsurf
- **Automation-Friendly**: Intended for use in automated workflows, allowing scripted or AI-directed hosting operations rather than manual dashboard use.
- **Programmatic Hosting Management**: Enables interaction with DreamHost hosting services via code or AI agents instead of direct control panel usage.

## Use Cases
- Integrating DreamHost management tasks into AI-assisted coding environments.
- Automating common hosting operations as part of CI/CD or other DevOps workflows.
- Allowing AI agents (via MCP clients) to interact with DreamHost resources as part of broader automation scenarios.
