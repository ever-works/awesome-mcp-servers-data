# Airbrake MCP Server

**Category:** Monitoring  
**Slug:** `airbrake-mcp-server`  
**Source:** https://mcp.pipedream.com/app/airbrake

## Description
Airbrake MCP Server exposes Airbrake error monitoring data through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing applications and chat-based clients to automate workflows and query collected application errors and aggregates.

Airbrake itself collects errors generated by other applications and aggregates them for review; this MCP server provides an MCP-compatible interface to that data.

## Features
- **MCP-compatible server**: Implements an MCP server endpoint that can be added to any compatible client or application.
- **Static server URL**: Single shared URL for all clients:
  - `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`
- **Airbrake integration**: Connects to Airbrake error monitoring to access:
  - Collected application errors
  - Aggregated error data for review and analysis
- **Authentication at client setup**: Uses the same static URL for all clients, with authentication handled when the server is added to your application or chat client.
- **Client-agnostic usage**: Designed to work with multiple chat clients; configuration depends on the chosen client.
- **Configuration documentation**: A dedicated configuration page (via Pipedream) describes how to add and configure the server in different applications.

## Usage
- Use the static MCP server URL `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2` when configuring your MCP-compatible client.
- Authenticate within your client or application when adding the server.
- Once configured, query and automate workflows around Airbrake application errors and aggregates via MCP.
