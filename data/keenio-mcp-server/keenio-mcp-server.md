# Keen.io MCP Server

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server integration for Keen.io that enables event data management—collection, querying, and application of event data—inside MCP-compatible applications.

## Overview
- **Type:** MCP server (data analysis & exploration)
- **Service:** Keen.io (event data platform)
- **Purpose:** Connect an MCP-enabled app to Keen.io for end-to-end event data workflows
- **MCP Server URL:** `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`

## Features
- **Keen.io integration via MCP**  
  Connects MCP-compatible chat or developer clients to Keen.io for working with event data.

- **Event data management**  
  Designed to support the lifecycle of event data, from collection through to application in analytics and downstream use cases.

- **Static MCP server endpoint**  
  Uses a single, static MCP server URL (`https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`) that works for all clients; authentication is handled when adding the server to your application.

- **Client-agnostic setup**  
  Can be added to different MCP-compatible chat clients or applications; configuration instructions vary by client but use the same base URL.

- **Configuration flow**  
  - Connect a Keen.io account
  - Select a Keen.io client (project/app) within the configuration UI
  - Add the MCP server URL to your MCP-compatible app and authenticate
