### Overview
Mercado Pago MCP Server is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that exposes Mercado Pago’s payment capabilities to AI agents. It enables agents to interact programmatically with Mercado Pago payment services, process transactions, and access related resources through a standardized MCP interface.

### Features
- **MCP-based integration**  
  - Provides an MCP server endpoint that AI agents can connect to.  
  - Uses the MCP protocol to structure requests and responses related to Mercado Pago operations.

- **Payments and transactions**  
  - Supports interaction with Mercado Pago payment services.  
  - Enables creating and managing payment-related operations (e.g., initiating or handling transactions).  
  - Accesses transaction-related resources (such as payment objects and associated metadata) exposed via MCP.

- **E-commerce and online payments context**  
  - Designed to work with Mercado Pago’s broader online payment ecosystem (e-commerce, in-person payments, and platform integrations).  
  - Suitable for scenarios like payment links, checkouts, and subscription flows when those are available via the underlying Mercado Pago APIs.

- **AI-agent oriented**  
  - Tailored for use by AI agents that need structured, programmatic access to Mercado Pago without directly integrating each API.
