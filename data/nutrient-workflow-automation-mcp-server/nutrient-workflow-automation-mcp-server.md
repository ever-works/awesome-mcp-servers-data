## Overview
The Nutrient Workflow Automation MCP Server is an MCP-compatible server (powered by Pipedream Connect) that connects MCP clients to Nutrient Workflow Automation. It enables orchestration and automation of business processes and workflows directly from MCP-enabled chat or developer tools.

## Features
- **MCP-compatible server**: Exposes Nutrient Workflow Automation capabilities through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing use from any compatible client.
- **Business process orchestration**: Connects to Nutrient Workflow Automation so clients can orchestrate and automate business workflows programmatically.
- **Static server endpoint**: Uses a single, static MCP server URL that works across all supported clients:
  - `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`
- **Client-agnostic setup**: Designed to be added to a variety of MCP-compatible chat or development clients.
- **Authentication at connection time**: Authentication is performed when adding the server to an application/client (exact method depends on the client and Pipedream configuration).
- **Configuration documentation**: A dedicated configuration page (on Pipedream) provides step-by-step guidance for adding and configuring the server in different clients.
- **Pipedream Connect integration**: Runs on Pipedream’s Connect infrastructure, allowing integration with broader Pipedream workflows and tooling.

## Usage
- Add the MCP server URL to a supported MCP client.
- Authenticate when prompted by the client.
- Use the client’s interface to trigger and manage Nutrient Workflow Automation workflows and business processes.
