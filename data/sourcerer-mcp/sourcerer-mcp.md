## Overview

**sourcerer-mcp** is an open-source Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides semantic code search and navigation for LLMs, helping them explore codebases more efficiently and reduce token usage.

## Features

- Implements the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** to integrate with LLM tooling.
- Provides **semantic code search**, allowing queries based on meaning rather than exact text matches.
- Supports **code navigation** so LLMs or tools can jump to relevant parts of a codebase.
- Optimized to **reduce token usage** by fetching only relevant code/context.
- Designed to help LLMs **explore large codebases** more efficiently.
- Distributed as a **Go-based server** (Go module with `go.mod` and `go.sum`).
- Includes **example command implementation** under `cmd/sourcerer` for running the server.
- Comes with **test data** under `testdata` for validating behavior.
- Includes contribution and community guidelines (`CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`).
