## Overview
The Teamup MCP Server integrates Teamup’s shared calendar and scheduling capabilities into MCP-compatible applications. It is designed to help manage schedules, availability, and events involving multiple people and resources, supporting schedule-driven business operations.

## Features
- **Teamup calendar integration**: Connects Teamup’s shared calendar into MCP-enabled clients and agents.
- **Scheduling & availability management**: Supports managing schedules, availability, and events for multiple people and resources.
- **Event coordination**: Built for operations that are driven by calendars and resource allocation.
- **MCP-compatible server endpoint**: Exposes a static MCP server URL that can be used across different MCP clients.
- **Central server URL**: `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2` is used as the MCP server endpoint for all supported clients.
- **Authentication at client setup**: Authentication occurs when the server is added to an application/client, rather than requiring different URLs.
- **Multi-client support**: Can be added to various MCP-capable chat or agent clients (e.g., via their “add server” workflows).
- **Configuration documentation**: A dedicated configuration page explains how to connect the server in different clients.

## Configuration & Usage
- Copy and use the MCP server URL: `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`.
- Add the server to any supported MCP client and authenticate during setup.
- Tools/actions are exposed via the MCP protocol and are discoverable as “available tools” within the client.
