## Overview
Ahrefs MCP Server is an MCP server integration that exposes Ahrefs SEO tools and resources to MCP-compatible clients, enabling automated SEO analysis tasks within chat or other MCP-based applications.

- **Category:** Business & Commerce – MCP Servers  
- **Tags:** SEO, marketing, analytics  
- **MCP Endpoint:** `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`

## Features
- **MCP-compatible SEO tooling**: Provides access to Ahrefs SEO tools and resources via the Model Context Protocol (MCP), so MCP clients can call Ahrefs-powered operations.
- **Static server URL**: Uses a single static MCP server URL (`https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`) that works across supported clients.
- **Client-agnostic integration**: Designed to be added to various MCP-enabled chat clients and applications.
- **Authentication at configuration time**: Authentication is handled when adding/configuring the server in your application (rather than using client-specific URLs).
- **Configuration documentation**: A dedicated configuration page (via Pipedream) explains how to add and use the server with different clients.
