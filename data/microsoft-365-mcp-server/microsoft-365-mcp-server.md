## Features

- **Microsoft 365 integration via MCP**  
  Provides an MCP-compliant server endpoint that connects AI assistants and clients to Microsoft 365 services (e.g., Outlook, OneDrive, and related productivity apps).

- **Static server endpoint**  
  Uses a single, static MCP server URL for all clients:  
  `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`

- **Client-agnostic configuration**  
  Works with multiple MCP-compatible chat or AI clients; you select your client and follow specific setup instructions.

- **Account-based access**  
  Connects to a Microsoft 365 account, enabling personalized access to productivity data and tools once authenticated.

- **MCP tools / actions exposure**  
  Exposes available tools and actions from Microsoft 365 to the client via the MCP protocol (the UI indicates “Available tools” and “Loading actions…”), enabling actions like reading or writing data through those tools (exact tools depend on configuration and account permissions).

- **Browser-based configuration flow**  
  Provides a web interface where you:
  - Connect your Microsoft 365 account.
  - Copy the MCP server URL.
  - Select your chat/AI client and follow tailored setup guidance.
