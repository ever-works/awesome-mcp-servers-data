## Overview
Action Builder MCP Server exposes the Action Builder organizing toolkit for use via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Action Builder is an organizing toolset developed in collaboration with organizers and the AFL-CIO, focused on labor and advocacy campaigns.

The MCP server is hosted via Pipedream Connect and is accessible through a single static URL that can be added to any compatible MCP chat client or application.

## Features
- **MCP-compatible server**: Provides an MCP endpoint that allows applications and chat clients to interact with Action Builder’s organizing toolkit.
- **Static server URL**: Uses one universal URL for all MCP clients:
  - `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`
- **Client-agnostic integration**: The same server URL works with any MCP-compatible chat client or application; authentication is handled during server addition.
- **Organizing-focused toolkit access**: Exposes Action Builder capabilities designed for:
  - Labor organizing
  - Advocacy campaigns
  - General campaign organizing workflows
- **Hosted infrastructure**: Operated via Pipedream Connect, so users do not need to self-host the MCP server.
- **Configuration guidance**: Documentation available for adding the server to various chat clients and for advanced configuration via a central Configuration page.
