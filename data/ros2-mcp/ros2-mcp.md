## Description
ros2-mcp is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for ROS 2 that exposes robotics capabilities and ROS 2 data to AI assistants. It enables AI-driven robotics applications and services by bridging AI agents directly into ROS 2-based robotic systems.

## Features
- MCP server implementation for ROS 2
- Bridges AI assistants/agents to ROS 2 robotics environments
- Exposes robotics capabilities through the Model Context Protocol
- Provides access to ROS 2 data for AI-driven applications
- Targets ROS 2 distributions including (from badges):
  - ROS 2 Humble
  - ROS 2 Jazzy (badge present, partial in content)
- Repository structure for extensibility and development:
  - `server/` for core server implementation
  - `installation/` for install and setup assets
  - `docs/` for documentation
  - `tests/` for automated testing
- Docker support via `Dockerfile` for containerized deployment
- Python-based project configuration via `pyproject.toml`
- Example server configuration via `server.json`

## Technical
