## Description
BusinessLogic MCP Server connects Excel-based models and spreadsheets into AI-driven workflows through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It allows existing spreadsheet logic to be used directly inside applications, chat clients, and automated business workflows.

## Features
- **Excel integration**: Use existing Excel spreadsheets and models as part of business workflows and applications.
- **Spreadsheet logic reuse**: Expose and reuse the logic already defined in Excel models within AI-driven flows.

- **Static MCP endpoint**: Provides a single, static MCP server URL (`https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`) that works for all clients, with authentication handled when adding the server.
- **Client-agnostic setup**: Can be added to different chat clients or applications that support MCP, enabling those clients to call BusinessLogic tools.
- **Configurable business connection**: Connect a BusinessLogic account and select the appropriate client within the Pipedream interface before use.

## Technical Details
