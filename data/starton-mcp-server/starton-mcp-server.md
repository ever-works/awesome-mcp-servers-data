# Starton MCP Server

**Category:** Blockchain & Crypto MCP Servers  
**Website:** https://mcp.pipedream.com/app/starton

## Overview
Starton MCP Server provides a Model Context Protocol (MCP) interface to Starton, enabling AI tools and chat-based clients to build and interact with blockchain applications using standardized MCP methods. It is hosted via Pipedream and exposes a static MCP server URL that can be integrated into compatible clients.

## Features
- **MCP interface to Starton**: Connects AI tools and chat clients to Starton’s blockchain capabilities through the MCP standard.
- **Static MCP server URL**: A single, static endpoint is provided for all clients:
  - `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`
- **Client-agnostic integration**: The same server URL works across different MCP-compatible chat clients.
- **Account-based authentication**: Authentication occurs when adding the server to an application, after connecting a Starton/Pipedream account.
- **Configuration via web UI**: Users can configure the integration and select their client through the Pipedream-hosted configuration page.
- **Tools exposure**: Designed to load and expose available Starton-related tools and actions to MCP clients (e.g., for blockchain interactions, smart contracts, Web3 operations), once configured.

## Usage
- Connect your account on the Starton MCP Server page on Pipedream.
- Copy the static MCP server URL: `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`.
- Add this URL as an MCP server in your preferred chat/MCP client.
