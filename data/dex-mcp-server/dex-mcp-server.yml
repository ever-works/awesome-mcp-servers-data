  ## Description

  Dex MCP Server exposes Dex as a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server so
  MCP-compatible tools and chat clients can access and manage relationship data
  and keep-in-touch workflows that Dex aggregates from LinkedIn, email, and
  other daily tools.


  ## Features

  - **MCP server endpoint**  
    - Static server URL for all clients: `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`  
    - Authentication handled when adding the server to an MCP-compatible application.

  - **Dex integration**  
    - Connects to a Dex account to surface relationship and contact data.  
    - Designed to work with data sourced from LinkedIn, email, and other daily productivity tools.

  - **Client-agnostic setup**  
    - Same MCP server URL works across different chat clients and MCP-compatible applications.  
    - Per-client configuration instructions available via the configuration page.

  - **Tool exposure via MCP**  
    - Exposes Dex capabilities as MCP tools/actions (listed dynamically as “available tools” in the interface).  
    - Intended for use by chat clients and agents to manage contacts, relationship context, and keep-in-touch workflows programmatically.
