  about the code repository, including files like `llms.txt`, `llms-full.txt`,
  and `readme.md`, for more accurate and relevant responses.

  - **No Configuration Needed:** Simple setup process; just point to the GitHub
  repository and connect your AI tools without complex configuration.

  - **Universal Access:** Works with any public GitHub repository and is
  compatible with GitHub Pages.

  - **Enhanced AI Coding:** Enables AI tools to understand repository context,
  improving the quality of code-related interactions.
