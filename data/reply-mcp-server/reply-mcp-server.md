## Overview
Reply MCP Server is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that connects MCP-compatible agents or chat clients to Reply’s digital services, technology, and consulting capabilities (where available). It is hosted via Pipedream and exposed through a static MCP server URL that can be used across clients, with authentication handled at connection time.

## Features
- **MCP-compatible endpoint**  
  - Provides a single static MCP server URL: `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`  
  - Can be added to any MCP-compatible chat client or application.

- **Connection to Reply services**  
  - Acts as a connector between MCP agents and Reply’s digital services.  
  - Exposes access (where available) to Reply technology and consulting-related capabilities through MCP tools/actions.

- **Account-based configuration**  
  - Users connect their account and select a client in order to start using the server.  
  - Authentication occurs when the server is added to the application, not per-URL.

- **Client-agnostic setup**  
  - Supports multiple chat clients; users can select their preferred client and follow specific instructions to integrate the server.  
  - A shared configuration URL / page is available for detailed setup instructions.

- **Tool / action discovery**  
  - The server exposes “available tools” (actions) that can be loaded and invoked by MCP-compatible applications.  
  - Tools are discovered dynamically by the client (e.g., shown as “Loading actions…” / “Loading available tools…”).

- **Hosted by Pipedream**  
  - Operated and delivered through Pipedream’s infrastructure and policies (Terms and Privacy), simplifying integration and hosting.

## Integration & Setup
- Copy the static MCP server URL: `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`.  
- Add the server to your MCP-compatible app or chat client.  
- Authenticate when prompted and select the relevant client/account.  
- Once connected, your client can list and use the available tools exposed by the Reply MCP Server.
