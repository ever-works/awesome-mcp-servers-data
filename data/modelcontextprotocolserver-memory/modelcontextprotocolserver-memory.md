# @modelcontextprotocol/server-memory

@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that runs locally via stdio. It can be started with tools like npx and configured in an mcp.json file as a "stdio" server, making it easy to add memory-style capabilities to MCP-compatible clients such as editors or agents.
