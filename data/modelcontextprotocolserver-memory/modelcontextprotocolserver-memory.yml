description: '@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory is an MCP (Model Context
  Protocol) server that runs locally via stdio. It can be started with tools
  like npx and configured in an mcp.json file as a "stdio" server, making it
  easy to add memory-style capabilities to MCP-compatible clients such as
  editors or agents.'
