**Category:** Business & Commerce – MCP Servers  
**Tags:** customer-support, productivity, screen-sharing

## Overview
Screendesk MCP Server integrates Screendesk’s customer support productivity tools with the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It enables AI agents and compatible chat clients to participate in customer support workflows and assist with screen-based help sessions.

## Features
- **MCP Integration**: Exposes Screendesk capabilities via a standard MCP server endpoint, allowing use from any MCP-compatible client.
- **Single Static Server URL**: Uses a shared static MCP server URL for all clients:
  - `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`
- **Per-Client Authentication**: Authentication occurs when adding the server in each application or chat client, rather than through different URLs.
- **Chat Client Compatibility**: Designed to be added to various chat clients so AI agents can access Screendesk tools from within those environments.
- **Support Workflows Integration**: Intended to help AI agents assist with customer support tasks and workflows.
- **Screen-Based Help Sessions**: Enables AI-assisted workflows that involve screen-based or screen-sharing style guidance.
- **Configuration Documentation**: A dedicated configuration page (on Pipedream) provides setup instructions for different clients.

## Setup
- Use the MCP server URL: `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`.
- Add this server URL to your MCP-compatible chat client or application.
- Authenticate when prompted by the client during setup.
- Refer to the provider’s configuration documentation for client-specific steps.
