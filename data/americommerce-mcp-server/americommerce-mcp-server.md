## Features

- **MCP server integration for AmeriCommerce**  
  Exposes AmeriCommerce’s B2B commerce capabilities through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), enabling programmatic access from MCP clients.

- **Static MCP server URL**  
  Uses a single static endpoint for all clients:  
  `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`

- **Per-client authentication**  
  Authentication occurs when adding the MCP server to a client application, allowing secure access tied to specific accounts.

- **AmeriCommerce account connection**  
  Requires connecting an AmeriCommerce account, after which you can select and configure the relevant client within the MCP environment.

- **Tool-based interaction model**  
  Exposes AmeriCommerce functionality as “tools” or “actions” that MCP clients can invoke (e.g., to automate commerce workflows). The UI indicates loading of actions and available tools, implying a catalog of operations once connected.

- **Client-agnostic usage**  
  Designed to be added to various MCP-compatible chat or automation clients via the same server URL and configuration flow.
