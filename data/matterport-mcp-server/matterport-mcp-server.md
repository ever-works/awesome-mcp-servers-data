## Overview
The Matterport MCP Server is an MCP-compatible server that lets MCP tools and clients interact with Matterport’s 3D capture and collaboration platform. It provides a static server endpoint that can be added to any supported chat or MCP-enabled client, with authentication handled at the client level.

## Features
- **MCP-compatible server**: Exposes Matterport functionality via the Model Context Protocol (MCP) so MCP tools and chat clients can work with Matterport.
- **Static server endpoint**: Uses a single, reusable URL (`https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`) that works across all clients.
- **Client-side authentication**: Authentication is performed when you add/configure the server in your application or chat client.
- **Integration with chat clients**: Designed to be added to MCP-capable chat applications for interacting with Matterport’s 3D content and collaboration features.
- **3D capture and collaboration support**: Built to enable access to Matterport’s platform for capturing, sharing, and collaborating around immersive 3D models of real-world spaces.

## Usage
- Add the static MCP server URL to your MCP-enabled application or chat client.
