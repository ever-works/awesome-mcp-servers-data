## Overview
The Verifone MCP Server is an MCP-compatible server hosted by Pipedream that exposes Verifone online payment processing and commerce capabilities over the MCP protocol. It provides a single static MCP endpoint that you can add to your applications to enable Verifone-based payments and commerce flows.

## Features
