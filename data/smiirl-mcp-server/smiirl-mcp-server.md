## Overview
The Smiirl MCP Server is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that exposes Smiirl connected counters—used for social media and other software metrics—to MCP-compatible clients (such as chat-based applications). It provides a standardized server interface so applications can interact with and display Smiirl social media or software counter data.

## Features
- **MCP-compliant server:** Implements a standardized MCP server interface for compatibility with MCP-enabled clients.
- **Static endpoint URL:** Uses a single static endpoint (`https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`) that works across all supported clients.
- **Client-agnostic integration:** Designed to be added to different chat or MCP clients without changing the server URL.
- **Authentication on client setup:** Authentication is handled when the server is added to the client application (details depend on the specific client configuration).
- **Support for Smiirl connected counters:** Integrates with Smiirl counters used to display social media and other software-related metrics.
- **Display-focused use cases:** Enables real-time or near real-time display of social and software metrics via connected counters.
- **Pipedream Connect integration:** Operates on top of Pipedream Connect infrastructure for hosting and connectivity.
- **Centralized configuration docs:** Additional configuration and setup details are available via a dedicated configuration page.

## Usage
- Use the static MCP server URL `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2` when adding the Smiirl MCP Server to your MCP-compatible client.
- Follow your chat or MCP client’s instructions to add a new MCP server and complete authentication during setup.
- Refer to the provider’s configuration page for client-specific configuration steps.
