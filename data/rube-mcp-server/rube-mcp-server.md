## Overview
Rube MCP Server is a straightforward Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementation for Rube, accessible via `https://rube.app/mcp` using OAuth 2.1. It provides a stable, standards-compliant communication layer between Rube and any MCP-compatible client or application, focusing on reliability and protocol compatibility rather than extended feature sets.

## Features
- **Standard MCP implementation**: Fully compliant with the Model Context Protocol specification.  
- **Bridge between Rube and MCP clients**: Acts as an intermediary so MCP clients can interact with Rube over a standardized protocol.  
- **Reliable communication layer**: Efficiently handles request/response message passing between clients and Rube.  
- **Clean, straightforward architecture**: Minimal, no-frills implementation designed for clarity and maintainability.  
- **Protocol compliance for compatibility**: Adheres to MCP standards to work with a wide range of MCP-compatible tools and agents.  
- **Lightweight design**: Minimal overhead for performance-focused deployments.  
- **Workflow interaction support** (via Rube capabilities):
  - Trigger automation workflows
  - Query workflow status
  - Manage automation sequences
- **Persistent service**: Runs as a long-lived service, ready to accept incoming MCP client connections.  
- **Standard endpoint access**: Exposed at `https://rube.app/mcp` with OAuth2.1 for secure access (as provided by Composio/Rube).

## Use Cases
- Integrating Rube with any MCP-compatible client or application.  
- Building custom workflows that use MCP as the interaction layer with Rube.  
- Establishing reliable client–server communication channels for automation.
