  # LIME Go MCP Server


  ## Overview

  LIME Go MCP Server connects Lime Go’s CRM and sales tooling to MCP-compatible
  clients, enabling CRM-related actions and sales workflows to be executed
  directly from those clients via Pipedream’s MCP infrastructure.


  - **Category:** Business & Commerce – MCP Servers

  - **Use Cases:** CRM operations, sales workflow automation, lead and customer
  management from MCP clients

  - **MCP Server URL:** `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`


  ## Features

  - **MCP Integration for Lime Go**  
    Integrates Lime Go’s sales and customer relationship management capabilities with MCP clients.

  - **Static MCP Server URL**  
    Uses a single static MCP server URL (`https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`) that works for all clients; authentication occurs when adding the server to an MCP-compatible application.

  - **Account-Based Configuration**  
    Requires connecting a Lime Go account and selecting the appropriate client configuration within the MCP setup.

  - **Client-Agnostic Setup**  
    Can be added to different MCP-compatible chat or agent clients, with client-specific setup instructions available.

  - **Tooling Exposure (Actions via MCP)**  
    Exposes Lime Go-related tools and actions to MCP clients (e.g., CRM and sales operations), allowing those actions to be invoked programmatically from within the MCP environment. *(The page references "available tools" but does not list them individually.)*

  - **Centralized Configuration Documentation**  
    A dedicated configuration page (via Pipedream) provides full setup details for connecting MCP clients to the server.
