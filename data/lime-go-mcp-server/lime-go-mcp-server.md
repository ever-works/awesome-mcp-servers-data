# LIME Go MCP Server

## Overview
LIME Go MCP Server connects Lime Go’s CRM and sales tooling to MCP-compatible clients, enabling CRM-related actions and sales workflows to be executed directly from those clients via Pipedream’s MCP infrastructure.

- **Category:** Business & Commerce – MCP Servers
- **Use Cases:** CRM operations, sales workflow automation, lead and customer management from MCP clients
- **MCP Server URL:** `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`

## Features
- **MCP Integration for Lime Go**  
  Integrates Lime Go’s sales and customer relationship management capabilities with MCP clients.

- **Static MCP Server URL**  
  Uses a single static MCP server URL (`https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`) that works for all clients; authentication occurs when adding the server to an MCP-compatible application.

- **Account-Based Configuration**  
  Requires connecting a Lime Go account and selecting the appropriate client configuration within the MCP setup.

- **Client-Agnostic Setup**  
  Can be added to different MCP-compatible chat or agent clients, with client-specific setup instructions available.

- **Tooling Exposure (Actions via MCP)**  
  Exposes Lime Go-related tools and actions to MCP clients (e.g., CRM and sales operations), allowing those actions to be invoked programmatically from within the MCP environment. *(The page references "available tools" but does not list them individually.)*

- **Centralized Configuration Documentation**  
  A dedicated configuration page (via Pipedream) provides full setup details for connecting MCP clients to the server.
