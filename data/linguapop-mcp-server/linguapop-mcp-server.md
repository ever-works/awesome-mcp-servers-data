## Overview
Linguapop MCP Server is an MCP integration that lets tools and chat clients trigger and manage branded, CEFR‑aligned language skill tests for candidates. It is delivered via Pipedream Connect and can be added as a static MCP server endpoint to compatible applications.

## Features
- **Branded language assessments**: Initiate language skill tests that can carry client or organizational branding.
- **CEFR‑aligned testing**: Assess language skills according to CEFR (Common European Framework of Reference for Languages) levels.
- **Candidate-focused workflows**: Designed for sending language tests to candidates in recruiting or learning contexts.
- **Anytime / anywhere delivery**: Tests can be triggered programmatically to candidates regardless of location.
- **Static MCP endpoint**: Uses a single static MCP server URL (`https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`) that works across clients.
- **Client-agnostic integration**: Can be added to different MCP-compatible chat clients or applications.
- **Authentication at configuration time**: Authentication is performed when adding the server to the application, rather than per-URL change.

## Use Cases
