**Category:** Content Extraction & Summarization MCP Servers  
**Brand:** scraptio  
**Slug:** `scraptio-mcp-server`

## Description
Scraptio MCP Server is a Pipedream-hosted MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides simplified web scraping capabilities for MCP-compatible applications and workflows. It exposes Scraptio’s scraping functionality via a standard MCP endpoint that can be integrated into chat clients and other MCP-aware tools.

## Features
- **MCP-compatible web scraping**: Access Scraptio’s scraping capabilities through the MCP protocol for use in AI/chat clients and other MCP-enabled apps.
- **Static MCP server URL**: Uses a single static endpoint for all clients:
  - `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`
- **Per-client authentication**: Authentication is handled when adding the MCP server to each client/application.
- **Works with multiple chat clients**: Can be added to various MCP-supporting chat clients (e.g., AI assistants or dev tools) via their MCP configuration.
- **Pipedream-hosted infrastructure**: Runs on Pipedream’s MCP infrastructure, so you don’t need to host or manage your own MCP server.
- **Configuration documentation**: A full configuration page (via Pipedream) explains how to connect and use the server with supported clients.

## Usage
- Add `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2` as an MCP server in your MCP-compatible client.
- Complete authentication during setup in the client.
- Use the client’s interface to invoke Scraptio-powered web scraping within workflows or conversations.
