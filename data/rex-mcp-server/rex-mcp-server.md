## Overview

Rex MCP Server provides programmatic access to the Rex real estate software platform via the Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing integration of Rex’s agency tools into MCP-compatible chat and automation clients.

## Features

- **MCP-compatible endpoint**: Static MCP server URL usable across clients:
  - `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`
- **Programmatic access to Rex**: Connects MCP clients to Rex’s real estate software platform for agency-related workflows.
- **Client-agnostic server URL**: Same URL works for every supported MCP client; configuration happens at the client level.
- **Authentication at connection time**: Users authenticate when adding the server to their MCP-enabled application (rather than having per-client URLs).
- **Integration via Pipedream Connect**: MCP server is powered by Pipedream Connect, enabling use within broader automation and integration setups.
- **Configuration guidance**: Documentation and setup instructions are available through a dedicated configuration page for adding the server to different chat clients.

## Usage

- Use the static MCP endpoint `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2` when configuring Rex as an MCP server in your chosen chat or MCP client.
- Complete authentication during server addition/connection in the client.
