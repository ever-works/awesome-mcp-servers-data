## Description
SugarCRM MCP Server connects the SugarCRM customer relationship management (CRM) platform to the Model Context Protocol (MCP), enabling AI agents and MCP-compatible clients to access and work with SugarCRM data and CRM automation through a standard MCP server endpoint.

A single static MCP server URL is used for all clients; authentication is performed when the server is added to an application.

## Features
- **MCP integration for SugarCRM**: Exposes SugarCRM as an MCP server so AI agents and MCP-aware tools can interact with CRM data and workflows.
- **Static server endpoint**: Uses a shared MCP server URL for all clients: `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`.
- **Client-agnostic setup**: Designed to be added to various MCP-compatible chat or agent clients; configuration is handled on the client side.
- **Authentication at connection time**: Users authenticate when adding the MCP server to their application rather than using per-client URLs.
- **Hosted by Pipedream Connect**: The MCP server is provided and operated via Pipedream’s infrastructure.

## Technical Details
