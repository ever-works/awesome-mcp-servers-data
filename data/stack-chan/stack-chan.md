## Description
stack-chan is a JavaScript-driven, M5Stack-based small robot platform. It demonstrates how to embed conversational AI on resource-constrained hardware by running a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server directly on an M5Stack device, enabling interactive, AI-controlled robotic behaviors.

## Features
- **M5Stack-based hardware platform**
  - Designed to run on M5Stack modules
  - Includes hardware case and mechanical design files (in `case/`)
  - Schematics provided (in `schematics/`) for hardware reference and customization

- **JavaScript-driven firmware**
  - Robot behavior implemented in JavaScript
  - Firmware sources available (in `firmware/`) for building and flashing to the device

- **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server**
  - Implements an MCP server on embedded hardware
  - Exposes robot capabilities for conversational and control use cases
  - Enables remote AI systems to interact with and control the robot via the protocol

- **Conversational and robotic interaction**
  - Intended for AI-controlled interactions with the physical robot
  - Suitable as a reference for building conversational robots on constrained devices

- **Web and UI assets**
  - Web-related resources included (in `web/`) for associated control panels or configuration UIs (details depend on repo contents)

- **Open-source resources**
  - Full source code hosted on GitHub
  - Documentation assets under `docs/`
  - Contribution guidelines and code of conduct included

## Typical Use Cases
- Reference implementation for running MCP on embedded/M5Stack hardware
- Example project for building JavaScript-based robots
- Educational and experimental platform for conversational robotics and edge AI

## Pricing
