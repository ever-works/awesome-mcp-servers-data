## Overview
MemoryMesh is a knowledge graph server that implements the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to provide structured, persistent memory for AI models. It is designed for graph-based, long-term memory in role-play, storytelling, and other conversational agent scenarios.

## Features
- **MCP-compatible memory server** – exposes a Model Context Protocol server for use with MCP-capable AI clients and tools.
- **Graph-based knowledge storage** – represents memory as a knowledge graph, enabling structured relationships between entities, events, and concepts.
- **Structured long-term memory** – supports persistent storage of conversational context and facts over time for AI agents.
- **Optimized for role-play and storytelling** – tailored for AI role-play and story generation use cases where continuity and world-building are important.
- **Memory persistence layer for AI models** – acts as an external memory backend that AI models can query and update.
- **TypeScript implementation** – server implemented in TypeScript (as indicated by repository badges and configuration files).
- **Docker support** – includes a Dockerfile for containerized deployment.
- **Schema and knowledge management UIs** – provides HTML tools such as `SchemaManager.html` and `MemoryViewer.html` to manage schemas and inspect stored memories/graphs.
- **Configuration via smithery** – includes `smithery.yaml` and a Smithery badge, indicating compatibility with Smithery for MCP server configuration and distribution.
- **Versioned releases** – versioned with changelog (e.g., v0.2.8) for tracking updates and changes.
- **Open source** – licensed via an included `LICENSE` file in the repository.

## Use Cases
- Enhancing AI role-play agents with persistent character, world, and plot memory.
- Maintaining long-running story arcs and relationships between characters in narrative applications.
- Providing AI assistants with a structured, queryable memory of prior interactions.
