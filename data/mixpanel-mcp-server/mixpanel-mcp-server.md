## Overview
The Mixpanel MCP Server is an integration that exposes Mixpanel’s product analytics capabilities through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It allows AI agents and compatible chat clients to access and analyze product usage data—such as events, funnels, retention, and engagement—via a standardized MCP endpoint.

## Features
- **MCP-compatible analytics endpoint**  
  - Provides a static MCP server URL: `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`  
  - Can be added to any compatible chat client or MCP-enabled application.

- **Mixpanel product analytics integration**  
  - Accesses Mixpanel’s product usage data.  
  - Supports working with events, funnels, retention, and engagement analytics (as exposed via MCP tools).

- **Account connection & configuration**  
  - Connects to a Mixpanel account through the Pipedream interface.  
  - Configuration flow guides you to select a client and authenticate when adding the server to your application.

- **Tool-based interaction**  
  - Exposes Mixpanel functionality as “tools” within MCP-compatible chat clients (e.g., querying analytics, although specific tools are loaded dynamically and not listed in detail in the provided content).

- **Client-agnostic setup**  
  - Single static URL works across all supported clients; authentication occurs per client when the server is added.
