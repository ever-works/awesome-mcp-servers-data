## Overview
Referrizer MCP Server is an MCP endpoint, provided via Pipedream Connect, that links AI agents and chat-based clients to Referrizer’s multi-location marketing platform. It is designed to let agents coordinate and automate marketing campaigns across many locations as easily as managing a single location.

## Features
- **MCP-compatible server endpoint**
  - Provides a static MCP server URL: `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`.
  - Can be added to any MCP-compatible chat client or AI agent.

- **Multi-location marketing integration**
  - Connects to Referrizer’s marketing platform, which is focused on multi-location and local business marketing.
  - Intended to support management of tens or thousands of locations with similar operational effort as one location.

- **AI agent automation**
  - Enables AI agents to automate and coordinate campaigns across many locations via the MCP interface.

- **Client-agnostic configuration**
  - The same static URL is used for all clients; authentication occurs when adding the server to an application.
  - Can be configured from various chat clients, with setup guided via a configuration page (not specific to one client).

## Usage
