## Features

- **MCP server for LiveSwitch**: Integrates LiveSwitch’s live video platform with MCP-compatible tools and clients.
- **Static MCP endpoint**: Uses a single, static server URL that works for every client:
  - `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`
- **Client-agnostic integration**: Designed to be added to different MCP-compatible chat or AI clients; configuration depends on the client you use.
- **Authentication at configuration time**: Authentication is handled when you add the server to your application or client (not embedded in the URL itself).
- **Pipedream Connect infrastructure**: Hosted and operated via Pipedream’s MCP infrastructure, so you don’t need to run your own MCP server.

> For detailed configuration steps, users are directed to a separate configuration page per client (not included in the provided content).
