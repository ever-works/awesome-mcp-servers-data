  # TextCortex MCP Server


  **Category:** AI Integration – MCP Servers  

  **Brand:** TextCortex  

  **Slug:** textcortex-mcp-server


  ## Description

  TextCortex MCP Server integrates the TextCortex AI assistant platform into the
  Model Context Protocol (MCP). It allows compatible clients and tools to access
  TextCortex’s content generation and productivity capabilities through a
  standardized MCP server endpoint.


  ## Features

  - **MCP-compatible server**: Exposes TextCortex AI assistant functionality via
  an MCP server that can be added to any supported MCP client.

  - **Static server URL**: Uses a single static endpoint for all clients:
    - `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`
  - **Client-agnostic integration**: The same MCP server URL works across
  different chat clients and applications that support MCP.

  - **Authentication at setup**: Authentication is performed when adding the MCP
  server to your application, rather than using per-client URLs.

  - **Configuration guidance**: Can be configured using client-specific
  instructions or via a general configuration page (through Pipedream Connect).

  - **Pipedream Connect integration**: Hosted and provided via Pipedream Connect
  infrastructure.


  ## Technical Details

  - **MCP Endpoint**: `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`

  - **Integration Model**: Add-as-server within any MCP-capable chat client or
  tool.
