## Overview
Aidbase MCP Server is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server integration for Aidbase, a tool that provides AI-powered customer support workflows tailored to SaaS startups. It allows Aidbase’s AI assistant capabilities to be accessed through MCP-compatible chat clients and applications.

## Features
- **MCP-compatible server**: Exposes Aidbase functionality through the standard Model Context Protocol.
- **Static server endpoint**: Uses a single static URL (`https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`) that works across supported clients.
- **Client-agnostic integration**: Can be added to any compatible chat client or application that supports MCP servers.
- **Authentication at setup**: Authentication is performed when adding the server to your application, rather than requiring per-client custom URLs.
- **Pipedream Connect integration**: Hosted and powered by Pipedream Connect, enabling easy configuration and deployment.

## Usage
- Add the MCP server to your MCP-compatible chat client or app using the static URL.
- Authenticate when prompted by your client during server setup.
- Optionally refer to the provider’s configuration documentation ("Configuration" page) for client-specific setup steps.
