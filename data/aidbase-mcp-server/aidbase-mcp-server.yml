  **Website:** https://mcp.pipedream.com/app/aidbase  

  **MCP Server URL:** `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`


  ## Overview

  Aidbase MCP Server is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server integration for
  Aidbase, a tool that provides AI-powered customer support workflows tailored
  to SaaS startups. It allows Aidbase’s AI assistant capabilities to be accessed
  through MCP-compatible chat clients and applications.


  ## Features

  - **MCP-compatible server**: Exposes Aidbase functionality through the
  standard Model Context Protocol.

  - **Static server endpoint**: Uses a single static URL
  (`https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`) that works across supported clients.

  - **Client-agnostic integration**: Can be added to any compatible chat client
  or application that supports MCP servers.

  - **Authentication at setup**: Authentication is performed when adding the
  server to your application, rather than requiring per-client custom URLs.

  - **Pipedream Connect integration**: Hosted and powered by Pipedream Connect,
  enabling easy configuration and deployment.


  ## Usage

  - Add the MCP server to your MCP-compatible chat client or app using the
  static URL.

  - Authenticate when prompted by your client during server setup.

  - Optionally refer to the provider’s configuration documentation
  ("Configuration" page) for client-specific setup steps.
