## Description
The HeySummit MCP Server is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration that allows tools and automations to interact programmatically with HeySummit’s virtual summit and event management platform. It is delivered via Pipedream Connect, using a single static MCP server endpoint that can be added to compatible chat or MCP-capable clients.

## Features
- **MCP Server for HeySummit**  
  Provides an MCP-compliant server interface to the HeySummit platform, enabling programmatic access from MCP-compatible clients.

- **Static MCP Endpoint**  
  Uses a single, static MCP server URL for all clients:  
  `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`

- **Client-Agnostic Integration**  
  The same MCP server URL works across different chat clients or MCP-enabled applications; configuration is handled on the client side.

- **Authentication at Connection Time**  
  Authentication is performed when adding the server to an application, so no per-client URL changes are required.

- **Built on Pipedream Connect**  
  Operates via Pipedream Connect’s infrastructure for MCP servers, benefiting from its standard configuration and hosting model.

- **Configuration Guidance**  
  A dedicated configuration page is provided (via Pipedream) to guide users through adding the server to supported chat clients and tools.

- **Use Cases (Implied by Platform)**  
  While specific API methods are not listed, the integration is intended to support automation and tooling around virtual summits and events managed in HeySummit (e.g., managing events, sessions, and related workflows programmatically).
