description: Elasticsearch provides MCP server capabilities enabling LLMs and
  other clients to interact with Elasticsearch clusters for managing indices and
  executing search queries using natural language, demonstrating a powerful MCP
  server integration. Several MCP server implementations exist to facilitate
  semantic and natural language search with Elasticsearch, including
  cr7258/elasticsearch-mcp-server, elastic-semantic-search-server, Elasticsearch
  Mcp, Elasticsearch Server, and Elasticsearch7 Server.

  # Elasticsearch


  [Elasticsearch](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch) is a free and open
  source, distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine. It is designed for
  scalability, speed, and relevance, and can be used as a vector database
  optimized for production-scale workloads. Elasticsearch is the core of
  Elastic’s open Stack platform and is suitable for a wide range of use cases
  including full-text search, vector search, analytics, and more.


  ## Features


  - **Distributed architecture:** Scalable and fault-tolerant design for
  handling large datasets and high availability.

  - **RESTful API:** Interact with Elasticsearch using HTTP APIs for indexing,
  searching, and managing data.

  - **Search capabilities:** Supports full-text search, vector search, and
  semantic/natural language search.

  - **MCP server integration:** Enables LLMs and other clients to interact with
  Elasticsearch clusters for managing indices and executing search queries using
  natural language.

  - **Data types:** Supports structured, unstructured, numerical, and geospatial
  data.

  - **Real-time search:** Near real-time indexing and searching of documents.

  - **Bulk operations:** Efficiently index or update multiple documents in a
  single request.

  - **Integration with Kibana:** Visualize and explore data, create dashboards,
  and perform analytics.

  - **APIs and clients:** Language clients available for various programming
  languages (e.g., Python, Java, etc.).

  - **Monitoring and APM:** Collect and analyze logs, metrics, and application
  performance data.

  - **Security features:** Basic authentication, API keys, and more (features
  depend on license level).

  - **Machine learning and AI:** Integrate with generative AI applications,
  vector search, and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) use cases.

  - **Extensible via plugins and modules.**

  - **Open source:** Licensed under Elastic License.


  ## Use Cases


  - Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

  - Vector search

  - Full-text search

  - Logs and metrics storage and analysis

  - Application performance monitoring (APM)

  - Security logs analysis


  ## Installation & Setup


  - **Cloud deployment:** Managed Elasticsearch Service on Elastic Cloud.

  - **Self-managed deployment:** Download and install on your own
  infrastructure.

  - **Local development:** Docker-based setup for Elasticsearch and Kibana for
  testing and development.


  ## Pricing


  - **Free and Open – Basic:** Includes core features and is open source.

  - **Trial license:** One-month trial includes all Elastic features; after the
  trial, reverts to Free and Open – Basic.

  - **Paid subscriptions:** Additional features and support available via
