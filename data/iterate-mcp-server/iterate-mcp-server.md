# Iterate MCP Server

**Description**  
Iterate MCP Server connects the Iterate survey platform to the Model Context Protocol (MCP), enabling AI-driven applications to create and manage simple surveys and forms for collecting product feedback and supporting better product decisions.

## Features

- **MCP integration** – Exposes Iterate’s survey capabilities as an MCP server so MCP-compatible apps and AI agents can interact with surveys programmatically.
- **Static server endpoint** – Uses a single, static MCP server URL (`https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`) that works for every client.
- **Authentication at client level** – Authentication is handled when adding the server to an application, rather than using client-specific URLs.
- **Survey and form handling** – Designed to work with Iterate’s surveys and forms for collecting user feedback.
- **Multi-client compatibility** – Can be added to different chat or MCP-compatible clients, with client-specific setup instructions.
- **Configuration guidance** – Central configuration page available for setup details and available tools.
