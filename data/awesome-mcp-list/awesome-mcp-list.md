**Type:** GitHub repository / curated directory  
**Category:** MCP server directories & lists  
**Source:** https://github.com/MobinX/awesome-mcp-list

## Overview

`awesome-mcp-list` is a curated GitHub repository that maintains a concise, continuously updated list of MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers. It acts as a directory to help developers discover, explore, and integrate a wide variety of MCP-compatible server implementations and related tools.

## Features

- **Curated MCP server directory**  
  - Collects and organizes links to MCP servers from across the community.  
  - Focuses specifically on implementations compatible with the Model Context Protocol.

- **Concise, categorized listing**  
  - Groups servers into topical categories (e.g., *Browser Control*, *Art & Culture*, and others in the full README).  
  - Makes it easier to browse and locate servers based on use case.

- **Browser Control MCP servers** (examples from the list)
  - `@recursechat/mcp-server-apple-shortcuts`: Integrates with macOS Shortcuts for automation via MCP.
  - `@kimtth/mcp-aoai-web-browsing`: Minimal web browsing using Azure OpenAI and Playwright.
  - `@pskill9/web-search`: Web search based on Google results without requiring API keys.
  - `@co-browser/browser-use-mcp-server`: Packages `browser-use` as an MCP server, including Docker support for Chromium and VNC.
  - `@blackwhite084/playwright-plus-python-mcp`: Uses Playwright via Python, optimized for large language models.
  - `@executeautomation/playwright-mcp-server`: Web automation and data extraction with Playwright within an MCP framework.
  - `@automatalabs/mcp-server-playwright`: Controls web browsers via Playwright through MCP commands.
  - `modelcontextprotocol/server-puppeteer`: Official Puppeteer-based server for web automation and scraping (part of the Model Context Protocol servers collection).
  - `@kimtaeyoon83/mcp-server-youtube-transcript`: Extracts subtitles and transcripts from YouTube videos for AI processing.

- **Additional categories**  
  - The repository includes more categories beyond Browser Control (e.g., *Art & Culture* and others), each listing relevant MCP servers; details are available in the full README.

- **Continuously updated**  
  - The list is actively maintained and expanded over time as new MCP servers and tools appear.

## Use Cases

- Quickly discovering existing MCP servers for integration into tools or applications.
- Exploring reference implementations when building new MCP-compatible servers.
- Comparing different MCP servers that target similar tasks (e.g., various browser automation approaches).

## Pricing

- Not applicable. The repository is a public, open GitHub list; no pricing or plans are specified.
