## Features

- **Centralized configuration**: same endpoint works across different chat / AI applications that support MCP.  
- **Authentication on connect**: authentication is performed when adding the server to your application (per-client auth flow).
- **Hosted by Pipedream Connect**, so no custom hosting of the MCP server is required.
- **Supports AI workflows** that need to interact with IFTTT applets and automations (e.g., triggering automations from within an AI chat client).

## Usage

2. Add this MCP server URL to your MCP-compatible chat client or application.  
3. Complete authentication when prompted by your client.
