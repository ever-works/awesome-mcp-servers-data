  # IFTTT MCP Server


  An MCP server that integrates IFTTT with the Model Context Protocol, allowing
  AI agents and chat-based clients to trigger and manage IFTTT applets and
  automations.


  - **Category:** Workflow Automation MCP Servers  

  - **Brand:** IFTTT  

  - **Source:** https://mcp.pipedream.com/app/ifttt


  ## Features


  - **MCP-compatible server** that connects IFTTT with Model Context
  Protocol–enabled clients.  

  - **Static server URL** for all clients: `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`.  

  - **Centralized configuration**: same endpoint works across different chat /
  AI applications that support MCP.  

  - **Authentication on connect**: authentication is performed when adding the
  server to your application (per-client auth flow).

  - **Hosted by Pipedream Connect**, so no custom hosting of the MCP server is
  required.

  - **Supports AI workflows** that need to interact with IFTTT applets and
  automations (e.g., triggering automations from within an AI chat client).


  ## Usage


  1. Copy the MCP server URL: `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`.  

  2. Add this MCP server URL to your MCP-compatible chat client or
  application.  

  3. Complete authentication when prompted by your client.  

  4. Use the client’s MCP tooling / commands to interact with IFTTT applets and
  automations.
