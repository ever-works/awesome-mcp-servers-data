**Website:** https://mcp.pipedream.com/app/gem

## Description
Gem MCP Server exposes Gem, an AI-powered recruiting platform for talent acquisition teams, as an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server. It allows compatible AI/chat clients to interact with Gem programmatically via a standardized MCP endpoint.

## Features
- **Standard MCP endpoint**: Single static server URL (`https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`) used across supported clients.
- **Client-agnostic configuration**: Same MCP URL works for every compatible chat client; configuration is done per client, not per server instance.
- **Authentication at client level**: Authentication occurs when adding the server to your application, enabling secure access to Gem resources and actions.
- **Integration with Gem recruiting platform**: Designed to work with Gem’s AI-powered recruiting and talent CRM capabilities (e.g., for talent acquisition workflows) via MCP.
- **Configuration documentation**: A dedicated configuration page (linked from the app) guides setup across different chat clients.
- **Hosted by Pipedream Connect**: The server is operated via Pipedream’s infrastructure, removing the need to self-host an MCP server.
