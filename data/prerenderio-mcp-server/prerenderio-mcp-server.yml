  # Prerender.io MCP Server


  ## Overview

  The Prerender.io MCP Server is an MCP-compatible integration that connects MCP
  clients to Prerender.io, a dynamic rendering solution recommended by Google.
  It enables JavaScript-heavy websites (e.g., Angular, React, Vue) to be
  rendered server-side so they can be crawled more accurately by search engines.


  - **Category:** Content Management MCP Servers  

  - **Brand:** prerenderio  

  - **Slug:** `prerenderio-mcp-server`


  ## Features

  - **Dynamic rendering for JS-heavy sites**: Triggers Prerender.io to render
  pages that rely heavily on client-side JavaScript so search engine crawlers
  receive fully rendered HTML.

  - **Improved SEO crawlability**: Helps ensure Angular, React, Vue, and other
  JavaScript frameworks are “crawled perfectly” by search engines.

  - **MCP server endpoint**: Exposes a static MCP server URL:  
    - `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`
  - **Client-agnostic URL**: The same MCP server URL works across all compatible
  MCP clients.

  - **Authentication at client configuration**: Authentication occurs when
  adding the MCP server to an MCP-compatible application or chat client.

  - **Configurable via Pipedream**: Set up and manage the Prerender.io MCP
  Server configuration through the Pipedream interface.

  - **Multi-client support**: Can be added to different chat or MCP clients,
  each following client-specific setup steps.


  ## Integration & Setup

  - Connect a Prerender.io account through Pipedream.

  - Use the static MCP server URL `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2` when
  configuring MCP clients.

  - Follow client-specific instructions to add and authenticate the server.
