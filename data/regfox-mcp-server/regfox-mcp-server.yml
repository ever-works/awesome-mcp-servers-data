  ## Features


  - **MCP-based integration**: Exposes RegFox functionality through the Model
  Context Protocol for use in compatible clients and tools.

  - **Event registration platform access**: Connects to RegFox’s event
  registration system designed for conferences, camps, classes, and similar
  events.

  - **Single static MCP endpoint**: Uses a shared MCP server URL for all
  clients:
    - `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`
  - **Client-agnostic usage**: Works with multiple MCP-capable chat or app
  clients; configuration is done on the client side.

  - **Authentication at connection time**: The static server URL is the same for
  everyone, with authentication handled when adding the server to an
  application.

  - **Hosted by Pipedream**: Provided and operated via Pipedream Connect
  infrastructure.


  > Note: The public content does not enumerate specific RegFox operations
  (e.g., create event, list attendees); it only states that the server provides
  MCP-based access to RegFox’s event registration and management functionality.
