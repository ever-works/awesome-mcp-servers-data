## Overview
The **Amazon SageMaker Unified Studio MCP for Spark Upgrade** is an MCP-compatible server that exposes Apache Spark upgrade and migration tooling through **SageMaker Unified Studio**. It is intended to help modernize existing Spark applications and clusters and migrate them to AWS managed services such as **AWS Glue** and **Amazon EMR**, using standardized **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** interfaces.

## Features
- **MCP server for Spark modernization**  
  Provides an MCP server that tools and MCP clients can connect to in order to drive Spark upgrade and migration workflows.

- **Apache Spark upgrade tooling**  
  Offers capabilities (via MCP interfaces) aimed at upgrading existing Apache Spark code and environments to newer Spark versions.

- **Migration support for Spark applications**  
  Focuses on helping move existing Spark applications to AWS services, including guidance or automation for refactoring and compatibility.

- **Cluster migration and modernization**  
  Targets migration of Spark clusters to AWS-managed platforms, reducing the need to operate self-managed clusters.

- **Integration with SageMaker Unified Studio**  
  Runs within or alongside **SageMaker Unified Studio**, enabling Spark upgrade and migration workflows inside a unified development and operations environment on AWS.

- **Targets AWS Glue and Amazon EMR**  
  Helps modernize and migrate Spark workloads specifically onto **AWS Glue** and **Amazon EMR**, aligning Spark jobs with AWS-native data processing services.

- **MCP-based interfaces**  
  Exposes its capabilities through **Model Context Protocol** interfaces, allowing compatible clients (such as AI assistants or developer tools that speak MCP) to programmatically interact with the Spark upgrade and migration tooling.

## Use Cases
- Modernizing legacy Spark applications to newer Spark runtimes on AWS.
- Migrating on-premise or self-managed Spark clusters to **AWS Glue** or **Amazon EMR**.
- Integrating Spark upgrade workflows into MCP-enabled development tools or AI agents.
