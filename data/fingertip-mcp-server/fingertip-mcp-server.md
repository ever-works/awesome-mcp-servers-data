The Fingertip MCP Server is an integration that exposes Fingertip’s all‑in‑one page builder capabilities to MCP‑compatible clients. It allows applications and chat-based tools to programmatically interact with Fingertip for business and content management workflows.

## Features

- **Single static server URL** – Uses a static MCP server endpoint (`https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`) that works across all Fingertip clients.
- **Per‑client authentication** – Authentication occurs when the server is added to an application, enabling secure access for each client.
- **Configurable connection** – Requires connecting a Fingertip account and selecting a client before use.
