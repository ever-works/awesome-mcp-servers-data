**Brand:** Getform  
**Source:** https://mcp.pipedream.com/app/getform

### Description
Getform MCP Server exposes an MCP endpoint that lets MCP-compatible clients interact with Getform’s form endpoints service. It enables programmatic sending, receiving, and management of form submissions through a unified MCP server URL.

### Features
- **MCP endpoint for Getform**: Provides an MCP-compatible interface to Getform’s form endpoint service.
- **Form submission management**: Designed to send, receive, and manage form submissions programmatically via MCP clients.
- **Static MCP server URL**: Uses a single static URL for all clients:
  - `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`
- **Client-agnostic setup**: The same server URL works across different MCP-enabled chat or automation clients.
- **Authentication at client level**: Authentication occurs when adding the MCP server to your application / client, rather than requiring separate URLs per client.
- **Account connection flow**: Supports connecting a Getform account and then selecting a client to begin using the integration.
- **Configuration guidance**: Integration can be configured via the Pipedream configuration interface, with client-specific setup instructions available.

### Usage
1. Connect your Getform account via the Pipedream interface.  
2. Copy the static MCP server URL: `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`.  
3. Add this MCP server URL to your MCP-compatible app or chat client.  
4. Authenticate within your client to start interacting with Getform forms and submissions.
