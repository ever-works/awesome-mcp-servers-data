  ## Overview
  imagesorcery-mcp is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that exposes computer-vision–based image recognition and image editing tools to AI assistants. It runs locally and enables assistants to search, analyze, and manipulate images via standardized MCP tools.

  ## Features
  - **MCP server for images**
    - Implements an MCP-compatible server focused on image processing operations.
    - Designed to be used by AI assistants through the Model Context Protocol.

  - **Computer-vision powered tools**
    - Provides local image recognition capabilities (computer-vision based analysis).
    - Supports image processing and editing operations on images available to the MCP server.

  - **Image analysis and search**
    - Allows AI assistants to inspect and analyze images programmatically.
    - Intended for use-cases such as understanding image content, extracting information, and related recognition tasks.

  - **Image manipulation and editing**
    - Offers tools for transforming and editing images (e.g., generic processing operations as exposed by the MCP server).

  - **Local-first design**
    - Tools are designed for local image recognition and editing, enabling assistants to work with images without relying solely on remote services.

  - **Configuration & integration docs**
    - `CONFIG.md` for server configuration details.
    - `LLM-INSTALL.md` and `GEMINI.md` for installation and integration guidance with LLMs and specific clients.

  - **Ecosystem integrations**
    - Badges indicate compatibility with the MCP ecosystem and common LLM assistants (e.g., Claude) via MCP.

  - **Open source licensing**
    - Distributed under the MIT License.

  ## Pricing
  - No pricing information is provided. The project is open source under the MIT License; it can generally be used and self-hosted for free, subject to the license terms.
