## Overview
imagesorcery-mcp is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that exposes computer-vision–based image recognition and image editing tools to AI assistants. It runs locally and enables assistants to search, analyze, and manipulate images via standardized MCP tools.

## Features
- **MCP server for images**
  - Implements an MCP-compatible server focused on image processing operations.
  - Designed to be used by AI assistants through the Model Context Protocol.

- **Computer-vision powered tools**
  - Provides local image recognition capabilities (computer-vision based analysis).
  - Supports image processing and editing operations on images available to the MCP server.

- **Image analysis and search**
  - Allows AI assistants to inspect and analyze images programmatically.
  - Intended for use-cases such as understanding image content, extracting information, and related recognition tasks.

- **Image manipulation and editing**
  - Offers tools for transforming and editing images (e.g., generic processing operations as exposed by the MCP server).

- **Local-first design**
  - Tools are designed for local image recognition and editing, enabling assistants to work with images without relying solely on remote services.

- **Configuration & integration docs**
  - `CONFIG.md` for server configuration details.
  - `LLM-INSTALL.md` and `GEMINI.md` for installation and integration guidance with LLMs and specific clients.

- **Ecosystem integrations**
  - Badges indicate compatibility with the MCP ecosystem and common LLM assistants (e.g., Claude) via MCP.

- **Open source licensing**
  - Distributed under the MIT License.

## Pricing
- No pricing information is provided. The project is open source under the MIT License; it can generally be used and self-hosted for free, subject to the license terms.
