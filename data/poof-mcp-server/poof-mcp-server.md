# Poof MCP Server

## Overview
Poof MCP Server is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server integration that connects Poof’s payment capabilities to compatible MCP clients. It enables digital businesses and creators to work with payment workflows spanning crypto and fiat currencies directly within MCP-enabled applications.

## Features
- **MCP server endpoint**: Uses a static MCP server URL (`https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`) that works across supported clients.
- **Poof account integration**: Connects to your Poof account to access payment-related workflows.
- **Crypto-to-fiat payment workflows**: Supports payment flows that move between cryptocurrency and traditional (fiat) currencies for digital commerce use cases.
- **Multi-client support**: Designed to be added to different MCP-compatible chat or app clients via configuration.
- **Tool-based actions (MCP tools)**: Exposes Poof-related actions as MCP tools that can be invoked from clients (exact tools not listed, but presented as “Available tools”).
- **Configuration via UI**: Provides a configuration step (“Configure Poof”) where you connect your account and select a client before using the server.

## Setup
- **Server URL**: `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`
- **Usage**: Add this URL as an MCP server in your client, then authenticate with your Poof account during configuration.
