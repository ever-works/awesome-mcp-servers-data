**Source:** https://github.com/goat-sdk/goat/tree/main/typescript/examples/by-framework/model-context-protocol

## Overview
GOAT MCP Server Examples is a set of Model Context Protocol (MCP) example implementations for the GOAT SDK. These examples demonstrate how to execute over 200 on-chain blockchain actions from large language models (LLMs) across multiple chains, including Ethereum, Solana, Base, and others.

## Features
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP) examples**
  - Example servers wired to the MCP spec for use with LLMs and MCP-compatible tooling.
  - Shows how to expose blockchain actions as MCP tools/endpoints.

- **GOAT SDK integration**
  - Built on top of the GOAT SDK’s TypeScript APIs.
  - Demonstrates practical usage patterns of GOAT for on-chain operations.

- **Multi-chain blockchain support**
  - Examples for interacting with Ethereum.
  - Examples for interacting with Solana.
  - Examples for interacting with Base.
  - Designed to extend to “and more” EVM and non-EVM chains supported by GOAT SDK.

- **200+ on-chain actions**
  - Shows how to trigger and manage a large catalog of on-chain operations via LLMs.
  - Focus on read and write blockchain interactions (e.g., transactions, queries, and other contract-related actions) through an MCP interface.

- **TypeScript example code**
  - Organized under the `typescript/examples/by-framework/model-context-protocol` path.
  - Provides ready-to-run reference implementations for developers using TypeScript.

- **LLM-centric design**
  - Oriented around enabling LLMs to call blockchain actions safely and programmatically.
  - Serves as a blueprint for connecting LLM agents or tools to real blockchain networks using MCP.

## Use Cases
- Learning how to connect an MCP-compatible LLM tool to blockchain networks through GOAT SDK.
- Using examples as a starting point for building custom MCP servers that expose blockchain actions.
- Prototyping LLM agents capable of performing on-chain transactions and queries across multiple chains.
