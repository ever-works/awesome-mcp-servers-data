name: Docs MCP Server
description: Docs MCP Server is a free, open‑source Model Context Protocol (MCP)
  server that indexes and serves version‑aware software documentation to AI
  tools. It can scrape docs from websites, GitHub repositories, package
  registries (npm, PyPI), and local directories, then semantically chunk
  content, generate embeddings, and expose powerful search over that corpus. The
  server runs locally or self‑hosted, supports multiple embedding providers
  (OpenAI‑compatible, Google Gemini/Vertex, Azure OpenAI, AWS Bedrock), offers
  optional enterprise OAuth2/OIDC authentication, and includes a web UI. It
  integrates seamlessly with MCP‑compatible clients such as Claude, Cline, and
  Roo to reduce hallucinations and provide accurate, version‑specific answers
  from documentation.

  ## Overview

  Docs MCP Server is a free, open‑source Model Context Protocol (MCP) server
  that indexes and serves version‑aware software documentation to AI tools. It
  can run locally or be self‑hosted and is designed to reduce hallucinations by
  letting MCP‑compatible clients query an up‑to‑date, version‑specific
  documentation corpus.


  ## Features


  ### Documentation Ingestion

  - Scrapes and indexes documentation from multiple sources:
    - Public or private documentation websites
    - GitHub repositories
    - Package registries (e.g., npm, PyPI)
    - Local directories

  ### Processing & Indexing

  - Semantically chunks documentation content for better retrieval.

  - Generates vector embeddings for indexed content.

  - Builds a searchable corpus optimized for question‑answering.

  - Maintains version awareness so answers can be tied to specific software
  versions.


  ### Search & Retrieval

  - Exposes powerful search over the entire documentation corpus.

  - Supports semantic search using generated embeddings.

  - Designed to return accurate, version‑specific documentation snippets to AI
  tools.


  ### MCP Integration

  - Implements the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

  - Integrates with MCP‑compatible clients, including:
    - Claude
    - Cline
    - Roo
  - Provides AI tools with structured, documentation‑grounded context to reduce
  hallucinations.


  ### Deployment & Hosting

  - Runs locally on a developer machine.

  - Can be self‑hosted in your own infrastructure.


  ### Embedding Provider Support

  - Works with multiple embedding providers, including:
    - OpenAI‑compatible APIs
    - Google Gemini / Vertex
    - Azure OpenAI
    - AWS Bedrock

  ### Authentication & Security

  - Optional enterprise authentication via OAuth2/OIDC.


  ### User Interface

  - Includes a web UI for interacting with and managing the documentation
  corpus.


  ### Licensing & Openness

  - Free to use.
