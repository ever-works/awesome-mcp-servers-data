- Enables AI assistants to retrieve and process CI/CD and code review information
- Can be configured to connect to private GitLab instances (though there are known issues with some private setups)

## Known Issues
- May fail to connect to private GitLab instances due to differences in API response structure (e.g., missing `owner` or `fork` fields)
- Errors such as "failed to create client" or "Invalid arguments: items.0.owner: Required, items.0.fork: Required" may occur
- Some issues may be resolved by patches or alternative plugins, as referenced in related GitHub issues
