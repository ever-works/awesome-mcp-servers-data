### Overview
Serena is a fully featured coding‑agent MCP (Model Context Protocol) server designed to give AI agents rich development tooling. It uses language servers to perform symbolic code operations, enabling advanced code understanding, navigation, and editing workflows. It also provides semantic retrieval and editing capabilities and integrates with other tools via MCP.

### Features
- **MCP server for coding agents**
  - Exposes development tooling capabilities to AI agents through the Model Context Protocol.
  - Designed as a toolkit for building or enhancing coding agents.

- **Language-server–based code operations**
  - Uses language servers to perform symbolic (structure-aware) code operations.
  - Supports advanced code understanding, including syntax- and symbol-level analysis.

- **Semantic code retrieval**
  - Provides semantic retrieval over codebases to locate relevant files, symbols, or sections of code.
  - Aids agents in grounding their actions in the most relevant project context.

- **Code navigation tooling**
  - Enables navigation across a codebase (files, definitions, references, etc.).
  - Helps agents follow relationships between symbols and modules.

- **Editing and refactoring workflows**
  - Supports structured code editing operations via the MCP interface.
  - Enables agents to perform higher-level editing workflows, such as multi-file or symbol-based changes.

- **Integrations via MCP and other interfaces**
  - Includes a primary MCP server plus additional integrations ("other integrations" mentioned in repository description).
  - Can be embedded into different agent stacks or tools as a development backend.

- **Developer-focused project setup**
  - Repository includes configuration for development containers (`.devcontainer`), VS Code (`.vscode`), scripts, and tests to support local development and contributions.
