# Rat Genome Database MCP Server

## Overview
The Rat Genome Database MCP Server is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration that connects applications and MCP-based agents to the Rat Genome Database (RGD). RGD is a primary resource for genetic, genomic, phenotype, and disease data generated from rat research.

## Key Use Cases
- Accessing rat genetic and genomic information from RGD within MCP-compatible clients
- Querying phenotype data from rat research for analysis or model context
- Retrieving disease-related data and annotations tied to rat models
- Integrating RGD data into data analytics and research workflows via MCP

## Features
- **MCP-compatible server endpoint**: Provides a static MCP server URL (`https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`) that can be added to any supported MCP client.
- **Connection to Rat Genome Database (RGD)**: Enables access to RGD’s genetic, genomic, phenotype, and disease data derived from rat research.
- **Client-agnostic configuration**: Works with multiple chat or MCP-enabled clients; users select their client and follow client-specific setup instructions.
- **Application integration**: Designed to be added as a server to applications that support MCP, allowing agents or workflows to query RGD data.
- **Central configuration page**: A configuration page (via Pipedream) provides more detailed setup and management options for the server.

## Technical Details
- **MCP server URL**: `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`
- **Authentication**: Handled when the server is added to the client or application (details provided in the client-specific setup flow and configuration page).
