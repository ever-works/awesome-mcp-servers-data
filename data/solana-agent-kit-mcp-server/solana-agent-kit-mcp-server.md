# Solana Agent Kit MCP Server

**Category:** Blockchain & Crypto MCP Servers  
**Brand:** Solana  
**Source:** https://github.com/sendaifun/solana-agent-kit/tree/main/examples/agent-kit-mcp-server

## Overview
Solana Agent Kit MCP Server is an example Model Context Protocol (MCP) server built on top of Solana Agent Kit. It enables LLMs to interact with the Solana blockchain and perform on-chain operations through a standardized tool/server interface.

## Features
- Built as an example MCP server implementation using Solana Agent Kit.
- Exposes Solana blockchain functionality to LLMs via MCP tools.
- Supports over 40 protocol actions for on-chain operations (e.g., common Solana program interactions, transactions, and account operations – details are defined in the Solana Agent Kit itself).
- Designed as a reference implementation for integrating Solana capabilities into LLM agents.
- Hosted in the `examples/agent-kit-mcp-server` directory of the `solana-agent-kit` repository, making it suitable as a starting point for custom MCP servers.

## Use Cases
- Letting LLM agents read and write on Solana via MCP.
- Using as a template/reference to build custom Solana-aware MCP servers.
- Experimenting with Solana Agent Kit capabilities in agent frameworks that support MCP.
