Bluesky MCP Server (Bluesky by Unshape) is an MCP-compatible server that automates interactions with the Bluesky social platform. It is designed to be used with MCP-capable chat clients and agents via a static MCP endpoint.

## MCP Server URL
- Static MCP endpoint (works for every client):  
  `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`
- Authentication is performed when adding the server to an application.

## Features
- **Bluesky automation via MCP**: Enables MCP-compatible agents and chat clients to automate interactions with the Bluesky social platform.
- **Static, reusable endpoint**: Single server URL (`https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`) for all supported MCP clients.
- **Client-agnostic integration**: Intended to work with multiple MCP-capable chat clients; configuration is done on the client side.
