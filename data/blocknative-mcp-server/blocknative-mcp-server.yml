  ## Overview

  The Blocknative MCP Server provides Model Context Protocol (MCP) access to
  Blocknative’s real-time core blockchain infrastructure and mempool data. It is
  designed to let AI agents and tools interact programmatically with blockchain
  and mempool information through a standardized MCP endpoint.

  and tools

    - Exposes Blocknative capabilities over the Model Context Protocol.  
    - Can be added as a server in MCP-compatible chat or agent clients.

  - **Static MCP URL**  
    - Single static endpoint: `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`.

    - Integrates with Blocknative’s core blockchain infrastructure.  
    - Intended for applications that need up-to-date chain data and mempool visibility.
