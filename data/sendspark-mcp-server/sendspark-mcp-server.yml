  ## Overview

  Sendspark MCP Server is an MCP integration for Sendspark’s video outreach
  platform. It allows MCP-compatible agents and chat clients to use personalized
  video messages as part of outreach and meeting workflows.


  The server is hosted via Pipedream and exposes Sendspark capabilities to
  MCP-based applications through a static MCP server URL.


  ## Features

    - Static MCP server URL: `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`  
    - Same URL works for all clients; authentication is handled during server addition to the app.
