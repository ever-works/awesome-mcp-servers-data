  # UpBooks MCP Server


  Simple and efficient business management MCP server for integrating UpBooks
  capabilities into MCP-compatible assistants and tools.


  - **Name:** UpBooks MCP Server  

  - **Category:** Business & Commerce – MCP Servers  

  - **Brand:** UpBooks  

  - **Source URL:** https://mcp.pipedream.com/app/upbooks  

  - **MCP Endpoint URL:** `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`


  ## Description

  The UpBooks MCP Server exposes UpBooks’ business management functionality—such
  as accounting, invoicing, and general business-management workflows—to any
  MCP-compatible client via a unified MCP endpoint hosted by Pipedream.


  ## Features

  - **MCP-compatible server**: Implements the Model Context Protocol so it can
  be used by MCP-enabled assistants and tools.  

  - **Static server URL**: Uses a single, static MCP endpoint
  (`https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`) for all clients.  

  - **Client-agnostic integration**: The same URL can be added to multiple MCP
  chat clients or tools.  

  - **Authentication at client setup**: Authentication is handled when adding
  the server to an application (details managed through the client’s
  configuration flow).  

  - **Business management focus**: Designed to surface UpBooks’ business
  management capabilities (including accounting, invoicing, and related
  workflows) through MCP.  

  - **Pipedream-hosted**: Operated via Pipedream Connect infrastructure for
  easier configuration and management.  

  - **Configuration guidance available**: A dedicated configuration page
  explains how to add and use the server across different chat clients (via the
  linked configuration docs).
