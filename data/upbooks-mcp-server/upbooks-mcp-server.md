## Description
The UpBooks MCP Server exposes UpBooks’ business management functionality—such as accounting, invoicing, and general business-management workflows—to any MCP-compatible client via a unified MCP endpoint hosted by Pipedream.

## Features
- **MCP-compatible server**: Implements the Model Context Protocol so it can be used by MCP-enabled assistants and tools.

- **Client-agnostic integration**: The same URL can be added to multiple MCP chat clients or tools.  
- **Authentication at client setup**: Authentication is handled when adding the server to an application (details managed through the client’s configuration flow).  
- **Business management focus**: Designed to surface UpBooks’ business management capabilities (including accounting, invoicing, and related workflows) through MCP.  
- **Pipedream-hosted**: Operated via Pipedream Connect infrastructure for easier configuration and management.  
- **Configuration guidance available**: A dedicated configuration page explains how to add and use the server across different chat clients (via the linked configuration docs).
