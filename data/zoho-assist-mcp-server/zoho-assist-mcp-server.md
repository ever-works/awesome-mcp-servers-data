## Features

- **Unattended access integration** – Enables control of Zoho Assist unattended remote access features via MCP.
- **Single static MCP URL** – Uses a single, static server URL (`https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`) for all clients; authentication is handled when adding the server to an application.
- **Client-agnostic setup** – Can be added to different chat or agent clients that support MCP, using the same endpoint.
