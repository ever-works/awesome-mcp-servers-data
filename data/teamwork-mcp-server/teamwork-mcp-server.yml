  # Teamwork MCP Server


  Project management software MCP server that exposes Teamwork’s project
  management features to MCP tools and agents.


  - **Category:** Project Management MCP Servers  

  - **Provider:** Pipedream  

  - **MCP Server URL:** `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`


  ## Features


  - **MCP-compatible server** for integrating Teamwork with MCP-based tools and
  agents.

  - **Static server URL** (`https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`) usable by any
  MCP-compatible client.

  - **Client-agnostic configuration**: same URL works across different chat or
  agent clients; authentication is handled when adding the server to the
  application.

  management and collaboration capabilities within MCP environments (e.g.,
  tasks, projects, collaboration workflows), subject to how the client tools use
  the server.
