## Description
mindpilot-mcp is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that lets AI agents generate and visualize code, architecture, and other technical concepts as Mermaid diagrams. It runs as a locally hosted web application and is driven by natural-language requests.

## Features
- **MCP server**
  - Implements a server compatible with AI agents via the Model Context Protocol.
  - Enables agents to request visualizations programmatically.

- **Mermaid-based visualizations**
  - Uses Mermaid syntax to render diagrams.
  - Supports code structure diagrams, architecture diagrams, and other conceptual diagrams.

- **Local web app**
  - Hosts a local web interface for viewing generated diagrams.
  - Designed to let you “see through your agent’s eyes” when exploring codebases.

- **Code and system understanding**
  - Aims to help visualize legacy codebases.
  - Supports architecting new systems through diagram generation.
  - Helps with documentation and communicating system design.

- **Project structure and tooling**
  - TypeScript-based project (`tsconfig.json`, `tsconfig.electron.json`).
  - Electron build configuration (`electron-builder.yml`) indicating a desktop-style app wrapper.
  - NPM package configuration (`package.json`, `package-lock.json`).
  - Changelog and TODO tracking (`CHANGELOG.md`, `TODO.md`).

## Use Cases
- Visualizing existing/legacy code to aid refactoring or onboarding.
- Designing and documenting new software architectures.
- Generating diagrams as part of AI-assisted development workflows.
- Creating Mermaid documentation diagrams from natural-language prompts.
