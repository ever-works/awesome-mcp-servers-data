# EasyCSV MCP Server

**Category:** Data Access & Integration – MCP Servers  
**Brand:** EasyCSV  
**Slug:** easycsv-mcp-server

## Description
EasyCSV MCP Server integrates EasyCSV’s spreadsheet handling capabilities into MCP-based workflows. It lets you import data from spreadsheets (such as CSV files) and send that data to webhooks or applications directly from MCP-compatible clients.

## Features
- **Spreadsheet import integration**: Add spreadsheet (e.g., CSV) import functionality into your app or MCP workflows in minutes.
- **Data routing to webhooks**: Send imported spreadsheet data to any configured webhook endpoint.
- **Data delivery to apps**: Forward spreadsheet data into other applications as part of an automated workflow.
- **MCP-compatible endpoint**: Exposes a static MCP server URL usable by any MCP client:
  - Server URL: `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`
- **Client-agnostic setup**: Same MCP server URL works across different chat or MCP clients; authentication is handled when you add the server to your application.
- **Configuration documentation**: Additional setup and configuration guidance available via a dedicated configuration page (linked from the product page).

## Integration & Usage
- Add the MCP server URL (`https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`) to your MCP-compatible chat client or application.
- Authenticate within your client when prompted to enable EasyCSV features.
- Use the server in workflows that need to ingest spreadsheet data and push it to webhooks or downstream apps.
