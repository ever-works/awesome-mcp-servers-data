## Description
currencyapi MCP Server is an MCP server wrapper around the currencyapi service that provides current and historical foreign exchange rates to MCP-based tools. It enables programmatic currency conversion workflows from compatible chat or agent clients via a unified MCP endpoint.

## Features
- **MCP-compatible server**: Exposes currencyapi functionality as an MCP server that can be added to any MCP-capable client or application.
- **Current FX rates**: Provides up-to-date foreign exchange rates for supported currencies.
- **Historical FX rates**: Supports retrieval of historical foreign exchange rate data.
- **Programmatic currency conversion**: Designed for automated currency conversion workflows within tools, agents, and chat clients.
- **Static MCP endpoint**: Uses a single static server URL for all clients: `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`.
- **Client-agnostic setup**: The same endpoint works across different MCP clients; configuration is handled when adding the server to each application.
- **Authentication on add**: Authentication is performed when you add/configure the server in your app, rather than per-URL customization.

  - Copy the MCP server URL.
  - Add the server to your MCP-compatible chat client or application.
