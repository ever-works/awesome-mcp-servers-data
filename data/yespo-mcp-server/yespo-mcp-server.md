## Overview
Yespo MCP Server exposes the Yespo marketing automation platform through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It allows MCP-compatible applications (such as chat or AI clients) to interact with Yespo’s enterprise-grade marketing and automation features via a standardized server endpoint.

## Features
- **MCP integration for Yespo**: Interfaces the Yespo marketing automation service with MCP-compatible clients.
- **Static MCP endpoint**: Uses a single, static server URL (`https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`) that works for all Yespo clients.
- **Account-based configuration**: Connects to a Yespo account and lets users select the appropriate client configuration before use.
- **Application-agnostic usage**: Designed to be added to various chat or AI clients that support MCP, enabling Yespo tools within those environments.
- **Enterprise-focused automation access**: Provides access to Yespo’s enterprise-level marketing and automation capabilities through MCP (e.g., campaigns, marketing automation flows, and customer engagement features, as exposed by the server’s tools).
- **Central configuration page**: Configuration can be reviewed and adjusted through a dedicated configuration interface on Pipedream.

## Technical Details
