## Overview
The Content Snare MCP Server is an MCP-compatible integration that connects MCP clients (such as chat-based tools) to Content Snare. It is designed to automate collection of information and content from clients and stakeholders, reducing manual follow-up and coordination work.

It is hosted and provided via Pipedream Connect.
