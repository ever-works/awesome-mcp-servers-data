## Description
VeyraX MCP is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that centralizes access to over 100 API integrations and UI components for LLM agents. By connecting once to the VeyraX platform, users can expose all their VeyraX-integrated tools to any MCP-compatible environment (e.g., Claude, Cursor, VS Code, Windserf), reducing the need to manage multiple separate tool connections and authentications.

## Features
- **MCP Server for LLM Agents**  
  - Implements the Model Context Protocol to provide custom tools to agentic LLMs.

- **Single Connection to Multiple Tools**  
  - One connection to the VeyraX platform exposes all previously integrated tools via MCP.  
  - Eliminates the need to configure each tool separately for each MCP client.

- **Centralized Control of Integrations**  
  - Access and manage 100+ API integrations through a single MCP server.  
  - Designed to function as a unified layer between LLMs and external services.

- **Support for Multiple MCP-Compatible Environments**  
  - Usable in any MCP client, including:  
    - Claude  
    - Cursor  
    - VS Code  
    - Windserf  
  - Intended to be portable across tools that implement MCP.

- **Integration with VeyraX Platform**  
  - Reuses tool connections already configured in a VeyraX account.  
  - Centralizes authentication and configuration at the platform level, then exposes them through MCP.

- **Open Protocol Alignment**  
  - Built around the open Model Context Protocol specification for interoperability with different LLM agents and MCP clients.
