## Overview
Yanado MCP Server is an MCP-based integration for Yanado that lets tools manage projects and tasks directly inside the environments where users already work. It connects MCP-compatible clients to Yanado’s project management capabilities so teams can handle tasks and projects without leaving their preferred work tools.

## Features
- **MCP-based project and task management**: Exposes Yanado project and task operations through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), enabling automated or AI-driven workflows.
- **Works inside everyday tools**: Designed so users can manage projects and tasks from within chat or other MCP-compatible clients instead of switching apps.
- **Static MCP server endpoint**: Single server URL usable across MCP clients:
  - `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`
- **Client-agnostic configuration**: The same endpoint works for multiple chat or MCP clients; users authenticate when adding the server to their application.
- **Configuration documentation**: Setup is supported via a generic configuration guide ("Configuration" page) explaining how to add the server to compatible apps.

## Technical Details
