  # Abstract - IP Geolocation API MCP Server


  ## Overview

  The **Abstract - IP Geolocation API MCP Server** exposes Abstract’s IP
  Geolocation API as an MCP-compatible server, enabling IP-based location
  lookups to be integrated into MCP clients and workflows. It is hosted and
  configured via Pipedream’s MCP infrastructure.


  ## Features

  - **MCP-compatible server**: Provides a static MCP server endpoint that can be
  added to any compatible MCP client.

  - **Static server URL**: Uses a single, fixed MCP server URL for
  configuration:
    - `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`
  - **Client-agnostic integration**: The same MCP server URL works for all
  supported chat or MCP clients; authentication is handled when adding the
  server to the application.

  - **ChatGPT (OpenAI) integration guidance**: Includes setup instructions
  specific to ChatGPT (OpenAI) as an MCP client, with a link to a detailed
  configuration guide.

  - **Central configuration page**: A dedicated configuration page on Pipedream
  for viewing and managing MCP server setup details.

  - **Account-based connection**: Requires signing in to Pipedream to connect
  your Abstract IP Geolocation API account and manage associated configurations.

  - **Pipedream-hosted**: Runs on Pipedream’s “Connect” infrastructure for MCP
  servers.

  - **Tooling placeholder**: Currently shows no concrete tools exposed in the UI
  yet (indicates that tools/endpoints may be added or expanded in the future).


  ## Usage

  1. Sign in to Pipedream to connect your Abstract IP Geolocation API account.

  2. Copy the MCP server URL: `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`.

  3. Add this URL as an MCP server in your MCP-compatible client (e.g., ChatGPT
  via the provided guide).

  4. Authenticate when prompted by your client or Pipedream during server
  addition.
