# Ticket Tailor MCP Server

**Website:** https://mcp.pipedream.com/app/ticket_tailor  
**Category:** Business & Commerce – MCP Servers  
**Brand:** Ticket Tailor

## Description
Ticket Tailor MCP Server connects Ticket Tailor’s online ticketing platform to the Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing tools and AI agents to automate event ticket sales and management workflows.

## Features
- **MCP integration:** Exposes Ticket Tailor’s ticketing and event management capabilities through the Model Context Protocol so MCP-compatible clients and agents can interact with Ticket Tailor programmatically.
- **Event ticketing automation:** Designed to support automation of online ticket sales and event management tasks (e.g., creating and managing events and tickets) via MCP-aware tools.
- **Static MCP server endpoint:** Uses a single static MCP server URL for all clients: `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`.
- **Client-agnostic usage:** The same MCP server URL works across different chat and agent clients; configuration is done per client when adding the server.
- **Authentication at configuration time:** Authentication occurs when adding the MCP server to an application or client, rather than using client-specific URLs.
- **Configuration documentation:** A dedicated configuration page (linked from the app page) provides instructions for adding the server to supported clients.
- **Built on Pipedream Connect:** The server is hosted and powered by Pipedream’s Connect infrastructure.
