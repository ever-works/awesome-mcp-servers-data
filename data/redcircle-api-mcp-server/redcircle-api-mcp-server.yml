  # RedCircle API MCP Server


  **Category:** Business & Commerce MCP Servers  

  **Brand:** redcircle  

  **Slug:** `redcircle-api-mcp-server`


  ## Overview

  The RedCircle API MCP Server exposes the RedCircle API through the Model
  Context Protocol (MCP), providing real-time access to Target product data
  without relying on custom scraping rules or maintaining web scrapers.


  ## Features

  - **MCP server for RedCircle API**: Implements the RedCircle API as an MCP
  Server for integration with MCP-compatible chat and AI applications.

  - **Real-time Target product data**: Provides up-to-date product information
  from Target via an API interface.

  - **No manual rules required**: Eliminates the need to define and maintain
  custom extraction or parsing rules for Target product pages.

  - **No web-scraper maintenance**: Avoids traditional web-scraping approaches
  and their ongoing maintenance overhead.

  - **Static MCP endpoint**: Uses a single static MCP server URL that works
  across clients:  
    `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`
  - **Client-agnostic integration**: Designed to be added to multiple
  MCP-compatible chat clients and applications using the same endpoint.

  - **Authentication at configuration time**: Authentication is handled when
  adding the server to an application, rather than embedding credentials in the
  URL.


  ## Integration & Usage

  - **Server URL**: Add the MCP server to your application using:  
    `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`
  - **Client setup**: Select your MCP-compatible chat client or app and
  configure it with the static server URL, then authenticate as prompted.
