  # Salesmate MCP Server


  **Category:** Business & Commerce MCP Servers  

  **Brand:** Salesmate  

  **Slug:** `salesmate-mcp-server`


  ## Overview

  Salesmate MCP Server is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server integration
  that connects MCP-compatible clients to the Salesmate CRM and unified customer
  platform. It enables chat-based or MCP-aware applications to interact with
  Salesmate data and workflows through a standardized MCP endpoint.


  ## Features

  - **MCP-compatible server endpoint**  
    - Provides a static MCP server URL: `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`  
    - Works across MCP clients; authentication is handled when adding the server to the client/app.

  - **Salesmate CRM integration**  
    - Connects to a Salesmate account as part of configuration.  
    - Designed to expose Salesmate’s CRM and unified customer platform capabilities to MCP clients (e.g., for sales, CRM, and customer engagement scenarios).

  - **Client configuration workflow**  
    - Connect a Salesmate account via Pipedream.  
    - Select a client (MCP-compatible chat or application) after account connection.  
    - Use the provided MCP URL inside the client configuration to enable interaction with Salesmate.

  - **Tooling exposure (via MCP tools/actions)**  
    - The server exposes its capabilities to MCP clients as "available tools" / "actions" (the specific tools are loaded dynamically and not listed in the source content).  
    - Tools are intended for CRM-related operations (e.g., working with sales and customer engagement data), though the exact operations are not enumerated in the provided content.

  ## Integration & Usage

  - Add the static MCP server URL to a compatible chat client or MCP
  application.  

  - Authenticate with Salesmate during the add-server flow.  

  - Use the MCP client’s interface to call the Salesmate tools/actions that the
  server makes available.
