## Description
Starwind UI MCP is a local Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for the Starwind UI open‑source Astro component library. It exposes commands, documentation, and structured information about Starwind UI components so AI-powered tools (such as Cursor, Windsurf, and other MCP-compatible clients) can understand and utilize the library effectively during development.

## Features
- **Local MCP server implementation** for Starwind UI.
- **Integration with AI coding tools** such as Cursor, Windsurf, and other MCP-compatible editors/assistants.
- **Surfaces Starwind UI commands** to AI tools, enabling automated or assisted usage of the UI components.
- **Provides documentation access** for Starwind UI’s open-source Astro components via MCP.
- **Exposes component information and metadata** so LLMs can reason about, suggest, and correctly compose Starwind UI components.
- **Dockerfile included** for containerized deployment of the MCP server.
- **TypeScript-based project configuration** (`tsconfig.json`) for typed development.
- **Linting and formatting setup** via ESLint and Prettier configuration files.
- **Package-managed Node.js project** (`package.json`, lockfile) suitable for installation and scripting.
- **Smithery configuration** (`smithery.yaml`) for discovery and distribution in MCP-related ecosystems.

## Technical Details
