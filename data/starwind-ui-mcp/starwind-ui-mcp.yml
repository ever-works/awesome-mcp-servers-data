  ## Description

  Starwind UI MCP is a local Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for the
  Starwind UI open‑source Astro component library. It exposes commands,
  documentation, and structured information about Starwind UI components so
  AI-powered tools (such as Cursor, Windsurf, and other MCP-compatible clients)
  can understand and utilize the library effectively during development.


  ## Features

  - **Local MCP server implementation** for Starwind UI.

  - **Integration with AI coding tools** such as Cursor, Windsurf, and other
  MCP-compatible editors/assistants.

  - **Surfaces Starwind UI commands** to AI tools, enabling automated or
  assisted usage of the UI components.

  - **Provides documentation access** for Starwind UI’s open-source Astro
  components via MCP.

  - **Exposes component information and metadata** so LLMs can reason about,
  suggest, and correctly compose Starwind UI components.

  - **Dockerfile included** for containerized deployment of the MCP server.

  - **TypeScript-based project configuration** (`tsconfig.json`) for typed
  development.

  - **Linting and formatting setup** via ESLint and Prettier configuration
  files.

  - **Package-managed Node.js project** (`package.json`, lockfile) suitable for
  installation and scripting.

  - **Smithery configuration** (`smithery.yaml`) for discovery and distribution
  in MCP-related ecosystems.


  ## Technical Details

  - Implemented as a Node.js/TypeScript MCP server.

  - Repository includes standard development tooling: ESLint, Prettier,
  `.gitignore`, `.npmrc`.

  - Licensed (see `LICENSE` file in the repository for specifics).
