# Cloudflare Observability MCP Server

**Category:** Monitoring  
**Brand:** Cloudflare  
**Integration Platform:** Metorial  
**Source:** https://metorial.com/integration/cloudflare-observability

## Overview
The Cloudflare Observability MCP Server is an integration that exposes Cloudflare observability and monitoring data to AI agents and other MCP tools via OAuth 2.1. Through Metorial, it allows workflows to query analytics, monitor real-time traffic, and analyze security events across Cloudflare infrastructure directly from an AI-driven environment.

## Features
- **Programmatic access via MCP**  
  - Provides an MCP server endpoint for Cloudflare Observability (`https://observability.mcp.cloudflare.com/sse`).  
  - Enables AI agents and tools to interact with Cloudflare monitoring and analytics data.

- **OAuth 2.1–based access**  
  - Uses OAuth 2.1 for secure, authenticated access to Cloudflare observability data from agents and workflows.

- **Analytics querying**  
  - Query Cloudflare analytics data from within your workflow.  
  - Useful for inspecting performance, usage, and operational metrics associated with Cloudflare services.

- **Real-time traffic monitoring**  
  - Monitor real-time traffic patterns across your Cloudflare infrastructure.  
  - Supports workflows that need up-to-date traffic insights for automation or analysis.

- **Security event analysis**  
  - Analyze security-related events within Cloudflare (e.g., attacks, threats, or security rules activity) from the same MCP environment.  
  - Enables incident investigation and security-oriented automations.

- **Workflow and AI agent integration**  
  - Designed to be used by AI agents and automated workflows hosted or orchestrated via Metorial.  
  - Lets agents trigger queries, inspections, or checks as part of broader operational or monitoring flows.

- **Metorial tooling support**  
  - Works with Metorial’s concept of tools (for performing actions) and resources (for read-only data).  
  - Can be combined with 600+ other Metorial integrations (e.g., GitHub, Supabase, Neon) to build cross-system workflows.

- **Observability and monitoring alignment**  
  - Integrates with Metorial’s observability and monitoring capabilities for MCP servers, enabling centralized tracking of the MCP server’s own health and usage.

## Use Cases
- Automating performance monitoring and alerting via AI agents.  
- Investigating traffic anomalies or incident patterns using real-time traffic data.  
- Running security event queries as part of automated incident response workflows.  
- Combining Cloudflare analytics with other data sources (e.g., databases, code repos) for richer operational dashboards.
