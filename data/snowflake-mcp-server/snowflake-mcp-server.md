## Overview
Snowflake MCP Server is the official open-source Model Context Protocol (MCP) server from Snowflake Labs. It enables AI agents (including Cortex Agents) and MCP-compatible tools to interact with Snowflake for prompting, querying, and orchestrating data and AI workflows.

## Features
- **MCP Server for Snowflake**  
  - Implements a Model Context Protocol server specifically for Snowflake.
  - Designed to be used by MCP-compatible clients and AI agents.

- **Cortex AI Integration**  
  - Supports Snowflake Cortex AI features via MCP.  
  - Enables prompting and AI-assisted workflows that operate directly on Snowflake data and objects.

- **Snowflake Querying & SQL Orchestration**  
  - Execute queries against Snowflake through the MCP server.  
  - Orchestrate SQL operations as part of broader agent workflows.

- **Object Management**  
  - Interact with and manage Snowflake objects (e.g., databases, schemas, tables, views) via MCP tools.

- **Semantic View Consumption**  
  - Access and consume Snowflake semantic views through MCP-based agents and tools.

- **MCP-based Workflow Integration**  
  - Integrate Snowflake capabilities into MCP-driven workflows (e.g., within IDEs, agent frameworks, or other tools that support MCP).  
  - Acts as a bridge between Snowflake’s data/AI stack and external agent environments.

- **Dockerized Deployment Assets**  
  - Docker configuration (`docker/server`, `docker-compose.yml`) to run the MCP server in containerized environments.

- **Python Project Configuration**  
  - Python-based implementation with `pyproject.toml` for dependency and build configuration.
