## Features

### MCP Integration
- Provides a single MCP server endpoint for all clients:  
  `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`
- Works as a static URL; authentication is handled when adding the server in your MCP-compatible application or chat client.
- Designed to be added to various chat / AI clients that support MCP servers.

### TeamWave Platform Coverage
- Connects to TeamWave’s unified platform that includes:
  - **CRM & Sales**
    - Access and manage contacts and deals.
    - Use AI workflows on sales pipelines and customer data (e.g., summarization, lead follow-up assistance, and deal tracking tasks).
  - **Project Management**
    - Integrate project data (tasks, milestones, project status) into AI-powered workflows.
    - Support for coordinating work across teams and projects from within MCP clients.
  - **HR & Team Management**
    - Interface with HR- and team-related data such as employees, teams, and assignments.
    - Enable AI workflows around team organization and collaboration.

### Unified Business Data for AI Workflows

- Allows AI agents / chat clients to:
  - Read and act on CRM records (contacts, clients, deals).
  - Interact with project data for planning, tracking, and coordination.
  - Incorporate team and HR-related information into workflow automations.
