## Features

- **MCP-compatible server endpoint**  
  - Provides a static MCP server URL that works across supported MCP clients:  
    - `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`
  - Designed to be added as a server in any MCP-enabled chat or agent client.

- **Piped (privacy-friendly YouTube) integration**  
  - Uses Piped as a privacy-focused alternative interface to YouTube.  
  - Allows MCP clients to access YouTube content via Piped rather than directly.

- **Client-agnostic configuration**  
  - Same server URL used for all clients; authentication occurs when adding the server in the target application.  
  - The setup flow is driven by selecting your specific chat client and following its MCP configuration steps.  
  - Additional configuration details available via a dedicated configuration page.

- **Tool-based access to actions**  
  - Exposes actions / tools through MCP for search and content access (tools are dynamically loaded by compatible MCP clients).  
  - Designed to be consumed as “available tools” within MCP-aware chat interfaces.

- **Account-based connection**  
  - Users connect their account before selecting a client and configuring the MCP server.  
  - The system verifies the account and then enables access to the MCP server tools.

- **Operated by Pipedream**  
  - Hosted and maintained by Pipedream, with its own terms and privacy policy governing usage.
