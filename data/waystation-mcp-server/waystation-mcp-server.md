## Overview

WayStation MCP Server is a remote, universal MCP server that exposes WayStation workflows and tools to MCP-compatible assistants (such as Claude Desktop, ChatGPT, and other MCP hosts) over OAuth 2.1. It acts as a secure, no-code integration hub connecting AI assistants to a range of productivity platforms (e.g., Notion, Monday, Airtable, Jira).

The original local WayStation MCP server has been deprecated in favor of this remote server at `https://waystation.ai/mcp`.
