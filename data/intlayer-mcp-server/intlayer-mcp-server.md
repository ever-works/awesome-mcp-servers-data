### Overview
Intlayer MCP Server is an AI-assisted Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for the Intlayer internationalization (i18n) and CMS tooling ecosystem. It is designed to integrate with compatible IDEs and AI clients to provide structured, programmatic access to Intlayer’s CLI and related tooling, enabling context-aware i18n and content operations directly from the development environment.

### Features
- **MCP-based integration**  
  - Exposes Intlayer capabilities through the Model Context Protocol so AI clients and IDE extensions can interact with Intlayer in a standardized way.

- **IDE assistance for Intlayer**  
  - Enhances compatible IDEs with AI-powered workflows around Intlayer’s i18n and CMS features.  
  - Intended for per-component internationalization in JavaScript applications.

- **Smart CLI access**  
  - Provides AI-driven access to the Intlayer CLI, enabling automated or semi-automated execution of i18n- and CMS-related commands.  
  - Facilitates tasks such as managing translation resources and content via the CLI interface.

- **Integration with Intlayer i18n/CMS tool**  
  - Built specifically to work with the Intlayer ecosystem, leveraging its type-safe, scalable per-component i18n model.  
  - Supports workflows that may include translation management, AI-assisted translation, and visual editing via Intlayer tools.

- **JavaScript application focus**  
  - Targets JS-based applications, aligning with Intlayer’s per-component i18n architecture.
