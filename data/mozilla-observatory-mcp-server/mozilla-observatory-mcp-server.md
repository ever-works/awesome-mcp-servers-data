It enables automated testing of public websites’ security posture, including HTTPS/TLS configuration and HTTP security headers, through the Observatory service.

## Features
- **Mozilla Observatory integration**: Interfaces directly with the Mozilla Observatory service for site security analysis.
- **Security configuration analysis**: Evaluates security settings of public websites, including HTTPS, TLS, and HTTP headers.
- **AI tool connectivity via MCP**: Exposes Observatory functionality through the Model Context Protocol (MCP) so AI tools can invoke scans and use results programmatically.
- **Pipedream MCP server implementation**: Runs as a Pipedream-hosted MCP server to simplify setup and connectivity.
- **Agent/tool interoperability**: Designed to work with AI tools and editors that support MCP, such as Cursor, Claude, and Windsurf.
