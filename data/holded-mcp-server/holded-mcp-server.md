## Overview
Holded MCP Server is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server integration that connects Holded’s smart business management and CRM platform for SMEs to MCP-compatible applications. It allows tools and chat clients to interact with Holded data for CRM and business management use cases.

## Features
- **MCP Server for Holded**: Exposes Holded functionality and data through the MCP protocol so MCP-enabled apps and chat clients can use it as a data/tool source.
- **Static MCP Endpoint**: Uses a single, static MCP server URL (`https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`) that works across clients.
- **Authentication at Client Setup**: Authentication is handled when adding the MCP server to your application or chat client, rather than requiring per-client URLs.
- **Chat Client Integration**: Designed to be added to compatible chat clients, enabling them to call Holded tools and access CRM / SME business management data via MCP.
- **Configuration Flow**: 
  - Connect a Holded account in the Pipedream UI.
  - Select the desired client to start using Holded tools via MCP.
- **Tool Exposure**: Provides a set of “available tools” that surface Holded CRM and business management actions (exact tools are dynamically loaded in the UI).

## Use Cases
- Access Holded CRM and business data from MCP-aware chat clients.
- Automate or script interactions with Holded via MCP tools.
- Integrate Holded’s SME-focused business management capabilities into AI assistants or other MCP-integrated applications.
