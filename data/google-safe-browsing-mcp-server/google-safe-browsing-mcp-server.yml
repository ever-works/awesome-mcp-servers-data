  ## Overview

  The Google Safe Browsing MCP Server exposes Google’s Safe Browsing service to
  MCP-compatible tools and clients. It allows applications to check URLs against
  Google’s continuously updated lists of unsafe web resources for
  security-focused use cases.


  ## Features

  - **URL safety checks**: Query URLs against Google Safe Browsing lists to
  detect unsafe or malicious web resources.

  - **Continuously updated threat data**: Uses Google’s regularly refreshed
  lists of unsafe sites for more current threat detection.

  - **Static MCP endpoint**: Single, static MCP server URL for all clients:
    - `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`
  - **MCP-compatible integration**: Designed to be added as an MCP server to
  chat or other MCP-enabled clients.

  - **Centralized configuration**: Works with a generic configuration flow via
  the Pipedream MCP configuration page (per linked documentation).


  ## Usage

  - Add the MCP server URL `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2` to your MCP-enabled
  application.

  - Authenticate as part of the server setup process in your client.

  - Use available MCP tools (as exposed by the client) to perform Safe Browsing
  URL checks.
