## Overview

**mcp-shrimp-task-manager** (Shrimp Task Manager) is an open-source MCP server that provides a programming-focused task management system for AI coding agents (e.g., Cursor AI). It converts natural language requests into structured development tasks, with support for task memory, dependency management, and workflow tracking to enable more agent-like behavior in reasoning AI systems.

- **Category:** Project-management MCP servers  
- **License:** MIT  
- **Primary use case:** Augment AI coding agents with persistent, structured, and self-organizing task workflows.

## Features

- **AI-focused task model**  
  - Designed specifically for AI agents and coding assistants.  
  - Emphasizes chain-of-thought, reflection, and style consistency in task handling.

- **Natural language to structured tasks**  
  - Transforms free-form natural language instructions into structured development tasks.  
  - Captures task metadata suitable for programming workflows.

- **Dependency tracking**  
  - Supports relationships and dependencies between tasks.  
  - Helps agents execute tasks in a logical, ordered workflow.

- **Iterative refinement**  
  - Enables tasks to be refined over time as more information becomes available.  
  - Supports iterative updates by AI agents during a development session.

- **Task memory & self-organization**  
  - Maintains task memory across interactions so agents can recall and build on prior work.  
  - Provides mechanisms for self-organization of tasks (e.g., grouping, ordering, or restructuring workflows).

- **Workflow tracking**  
  - Tracks the state and progress of tasks throughout a development workflow.  
  - Enables reasoning systems to behave more like persistent, organized developer agents.

- **MCP server integration**  
  - Exposes functionality via the Model Context Protocol (MCP).  
  - Integrates with tools that support MCP (e.g., Cursor AI) for direct, in-context task management.
