## Overview
APIpie.ai MCP Server is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that connects applications to APIpie.ai via a static MCP endpoint. It is designed to provide access to a range of AI capabilities through compatible MCP clients.

## Features
- **MCP-compatible server**: Exposes a standard MCP endpoint that can be added to any supported MCP chat client or application.
- **Single static endpoint**: Uses a single static URL (`https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`) that works across all supported clients.
- **Account-based configuration**: Requires connecting/configuring an APIpie.ai account before use.
- **Client-agnostic integration**: Documentation and setup flows for multiple chat clients; the same server URL is reused across them.
- **Tool-based interaction**: Provides access to “tools” / “actions” through the MCP interface (listed dynamically as “available tools” in the UI).
- **Central configuration page**: Additional configuration options and instructions available via a dedicated configuration page on Pipedream.

## Use Cases
- Integrating APIpie.ai’s AI capabilities into MCP-enabled chat or IDE clients.  
- Centralizing AI access for different clients through a single MCP server URL.
