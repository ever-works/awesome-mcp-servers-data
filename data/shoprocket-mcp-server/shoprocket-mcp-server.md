## Overview
Shoprocket MCP Server is an MCP Server integration that connects MCP-based tools and chat clients to Shoprocket’s eCommerce platform. It enables interactions with Shoprocket for selling across existing websites, hosted stores, and social media channels through a unified MCP endpoint.

## Features
- **MCP integration for Shoprocket**: Exposes Shoprocket’s eCommerce capabilities through the Model Context Protocol so compatible clients and tools can interact with Shoprocket.
- **Single static MCP endpoint**: Uses a shared MCP server URL for all clients: `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`.
- **Client-agnostic setup**: The same server URL works across different MCP-enabled chat clients; configuration is done per client.
- **Authentication at client level**: Authentication occurs when adding the MCP server to an application or client, rather than requiring a per-client endpoint.
- **Multi-channel commerce support (via Shoprocket)**:
  - Sell via existing websites.
  - Use hosted Shoprocket stores.
  - Sell through social media channels and other online surfaces (as supported by Shoprocket).
- **No-code friendly use of Shoprocket**: Leverages Shoprocket’s “no technical skills required” approach, enabling non-technical users to access eCommerce workflows through MCP-powered tools.
- **0% platform fee environment (via Shoprocket)**: Operates against Shoprocket’s platform, which charges 0% platform fees.
- **Configuration documentation**: Full configuration and usage details available via a dedicated configuration page linked from the app.

## Usage
- Add the MCP server to any supported chat client using:
  - **Server URL:** `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`
- Follow that client’s instructions to authenticate and configure the Shoprocket MCP integration.
