## Overview
The Datumbox MCP Server exposes Datumbox’s machine learning and NLP capabilities through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing compatible chat or agent clients to connect to Datumbox via a standardized server endpoint.

The server is operated via Pipedream Connect and is accessible through a static URL that can be used across different MCP-compatible clients.

## Features

- **MCP-compatible endpoint**  
  - Provides a static MCP server URL that works with any MCP client:

  - Designed to be added to chat or agent applications that support MCP.

- **Datumbox NLP integration**  
  - Connects clients to Datumbox, a platform focused on natural language processing and machine learning (specific NLP tools are not listed in the provided content, but the integration is oriented around NLP use cases).

- **Authentication handled on add**

- **Client-agnostic setup**  
  - Instructions are available for multiple chat clients (via the “select your chat client” flow) so the same server can be integrated into different tools.
