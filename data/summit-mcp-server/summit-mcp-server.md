## Features

- **Triggers access**: Exposes Summit triggers that can be used to react to events across connected platforms.
- **Actions access**: Provides Summit actions that can be invoked by agents to perform operations in supported services.
- **Models access**: Makes Summit models available so agents can use them as part of automated workflows.
- **Multi-client support**: Designed to be added to various MCP-compatible chat clients (configuration instructions are client-specific).

## Configuration
