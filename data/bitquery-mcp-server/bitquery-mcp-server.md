## Features
- **MCP-compatible blockchain data access**: Exposes Bitquery’s blockchain and cryptocurrency data products through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing integration with MCP clients.

  - `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`
- **Client-agnostic integration**: Designed to work with any MCP-capable chat client or application.
- **Authentication at client setup**: Authentication is performed when adding the server to your application, not via per-client URLs.
