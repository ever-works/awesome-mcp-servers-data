    - Enables retrieval and analysis of college football statistics and analytics (e.g., games, teams, seasons, and related stats, as supported by CFBD’s API).

  - **Static server URL**
    - Single shared URL for all clients: `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`.
    - Simplifies configuration across different tools and environments.

  - **Authentication at client setup**
    - You authenticate when adding the server to your application, allowing secure access to CFBD data (details handled at client configuration stage).
