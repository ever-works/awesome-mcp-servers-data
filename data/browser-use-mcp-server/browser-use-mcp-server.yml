  ## Description

  Browser Use MCP Server is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that packages
  the `browser-use` automation framework and exposes it via SSE transport. It
  provides a Dockerized environment with Chromium and VNC for remote, automated
  browser control and web interaction, suitable for browsing, scraping, and
  other headless or remotely controlled browser tasks.


  ## Features

  - **MCP Server for `browser-use`**
    - Wraps the `browser-use` browser automation framework as an MCP-compatible server.
    - Enables LLM tools / MCP clients (e.g., editors like Cursor) to control a browser via MCP.

  - **SSE Transport**
    - Uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) for communication between MCP clients and the browser automation backend.

  - **Dockerized Browser Environment**
    - Includes a Docker setup to run the service in a containerized environment.
    - Ships with a Dockerfile for reproducible builds and deployment.
    - Designed to bundle a Chromium-based browser inside the container.

  - **Chromium Integration**
    - Runs Chromium in a headless or automation-ready mode within the container.
    - Suitable for automated browsing, form filling, navigation, and scraping workflows.

  - **VNC Support for Remote Control**
    - Provides VNC support for remote visual control and inspection of the browser running inside the container.
    - Allows users to connect to the running browser session for debugging or manual intervention.

  - **Configuration & Environment Management**
    - `.env.example` for environment-variable-based configuration.
    - `.dockerignore` and `.gitignore` for clean container and repository management.

  - **Code Quality & Tooling**
    - Python project configuration files such as `.flake8`, `.pylintrc`, `.python-version`.
    - Security and linting setup with `.bandit.yml` and `.mega-linter.yml`.
    - Contributor documentation via `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.

  - **Open Source License**
    - Distributed with a LICENSE file (see repository for specific terms).

  ## Use Cases

  - Automating web browsing from MCP-enabled editors or tools.

  - Running web scraping or data extraction workflows via a standardized MCP
  interface.

  - Remote visual debugging of automated browser sessions through VNC.

  - Containerized, reproducible browser automation environments for development
  or CI.
