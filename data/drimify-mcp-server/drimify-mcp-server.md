## Overview
Drimify MCP Server is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server integration that connects MCP-compatible tools and chat clients to Drimify. It enables programmatic creation and management of gamified experiences and games through a unified MCP endpoint hosted by Pipedream.

## MCP Endpoint
- **Server URL:** `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`  
  - Static URL shared across all supported MCP clients.
  - Authentication is performed when adding/configuring the server in a client or application.

## Features
- **MCP Integration Layer**  
  - Provides a standardized MCP server endpoint compatible with multiple chat clients and MCP tools.  
  - Centralizes configuration so the same server URL is reused across clients.

- **Programmatic Gamification Access**  
  - Designed to integrate with Drimify’s platform for games and gamified experiences.  
  - Intended for creating and managing games and gamification workflows through MCP-capable environments (e.g., AI assistants, chat apps, or tools that support MCP servers).

- **Client-Agnostic Setup**  
  - Single, static URL usable in any supported MCP client.  
  - Setup is handled within each client by adding the MCP server and authenticating.

- **Hosted by Pipedream Connect**  
  - Server runs on Pipedream’s MCP infrastructure.  
  - Configuration details and additional setup guidance are available on Pipedream’s **Configuration** page.

## Usage & Integration
- Copy the MCP server URL: `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`.
- Add the server to your MCP-compatible app or chat client.
- Authenticate within the client as prompted.
- Use the client’s interface to call Drimify-related MCP tools (e.g., to handle gamified experiences and games).
