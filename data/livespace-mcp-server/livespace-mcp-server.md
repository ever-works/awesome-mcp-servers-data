## Features

- **MCP access to Livespace CRM**  
  - Connects Livespace CRM as an MCP server so it can be used from compatible MCP clients (e.g., chat applications that support MCP).  
  - Central URL endpoint for MCP access: `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`.

- **Static MCP Server URL**  
  - Uses a single, static MCP server URL that works for every Livespace client.  
  - Authentication occurs when adding/configuring the server in your MCP-compatible application, not via different per-tenant URLs.

- **Account connection & client selection**  
  - Flow to connect a Livespace account and select the corresponding client instance before using the MCP tools.

- **Tooling exposure for Livespace CRM**  
  - Designed to expose “actions” and “available tools” from Livespace CRM into MCP; tools are loaded dynamically from the server.  
  - Intended to support sales process management and CRM automation operations from within MCP environments (e.g., managing pipelines, CRM records, and sales workflows, as supported by Livespace CRM via MCP).

- **Configuration guidance**  
  - Integration instructions available via a dedicated configuration page (linked as “Configuration page”) to help add the server to different chat or MCP clients.
