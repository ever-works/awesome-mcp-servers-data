## Overview
The eWebinar MCP Server is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server hosted on Pipedream Connect that integrates with eWebinar. It is designed to connect chat-based or MCP-compatible applications to eWebinar so they can automate and interact with scheduled and on-demand webinars from within workflows.

The server is accessed through a single static MCP endpoint and is authenticated per client when added to an application.
