## Overview
The Fivetran MCP Server is an MCP-compatible endpoint that allows MCP agents and clients to orchestrate and leverage Fivetran’s modern data movement and ETL/ELT pipelines. It is provided via Pipedream Connect and can be added as a static MCP server URL to any supported chat client or MCP-compatible application.

## Features
- **MCP-compatible server endpoint**  
  - Exposes Fivetran functionality through the Model Context Protocol (MCP) so agents and tools can integrate data movement workflows.

- **Static server URL**  
  - Single shared endpoint for all clients:  
    `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`  
  - Authentication is handled when adding/configuring the server in your client.

- **Integration with MCP-enabled chat clients and apps**  
  - Can be added to supported chat clients to let agents call Fivetran via MCP.  
  - Uses the same configuration pattern as other Pipedream-powered MCP servers.

- **Backed by Pipedream Connect**  
  - Hosted and delivered via Pipedream’s Connect platform, abstracting infrastructure and server management from the end user.
