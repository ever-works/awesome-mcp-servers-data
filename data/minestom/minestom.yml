  # Minestom


  [Minestom](https://github.com/Minestom/Minestom) is an open-source,
  developer-centric Minecraft server library written in Java. It is designed to
  enable developers to create custom, high-performance Minecraft server software
  that does not include any vanilla features by default, providing a modular and
  extensible API.


  ## Features

  - **Open-source Java library**: Minestom is a pure Java library and is
  available under the Apache-2.0 license.

  - **No Mojang code**: Completely independent from Mojang's server code.

  - **No vanilla features by default**: Provides a blank slate for custom server
  development.

  - **Modern, modular API**: Designed for extensibility and ease of use for
  developers.

  - **Multi-threaded architecture**: Utilizes a thread pool to manage chunks and
  instances for better performance and scalability.

  - **Instance system**: Lightweight, scalable collections of blocks and
  entities (alternative to traditional worlds), supporting custom serialization
  and in-memory storage.

  - **Blocks**: Visual representation of all blocks by default; custom handlers
  are required for interactive or special blocks.

  - **Entities**: Flexible entity system without predefined passive/aggressive
  behavior; allows custom entity behaviors.

  - **Inventory management**: Native support for inventories as client-server
  interfaces with clickable items and callbacks.

  - **Command API**: Integrated with Brigadier for advanced command parsing and
  argument types.

  - **High performance**: Designed to remove the overhead caused by unnecessary
  vanilla features, suitable for minigames, creative servers, and custom game
  modes.

  - **Not compatible with Bukkit/Forge/Sponge plugins**: Does not implement
  their APIs.

  - **Does not work with older clients**: Only supports newer Minecraft
  versions.

  - **Extensive documentation and community support**: Includes official wiki,
  javadocs, and active GitHub repository.


  ## Pricing

  - **Free and open-source** under the Apache-2.0 license.
