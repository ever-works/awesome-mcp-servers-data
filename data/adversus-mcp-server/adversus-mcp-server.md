## Description
Adversus MCP Server is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that integrates with the Adversus dialer platform. It enables automated workflows around outbound calling and telemarketing operations by exposing Adversus dialer capabilities to MCP-compatible chat or agent applications via a static MCP endpoint.

## Features
- **MCP-compatible server**: Exposes Adversus dialer functionality through the MCP protocol for use in chat or agent applications.
- **Static server URL**: Uses a single static MCP endpoint for all clients: `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`.
- **Authentication at connection time**: Authentication is handled when adding the server to your application, allowing the same MCP URL to be reused across different clients.
- **Outbound calling workflows** (implied by integration purpose): Designed to support automation around outbound calling and telemarketing activities built on top of Adversus dialer.
- **Chat client integration**: Can be added to compatible chat clients to enable telephony-related tools and actions within conversational interfaces.
- **Configuration documentation**: A dedicated configuration page (on the provider site) explains how to add and configure the MCP server with supported clients.
