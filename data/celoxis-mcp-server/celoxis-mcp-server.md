## Overview
Celoxis MCP Server is an MCP-compatible server, powered by Pipedream Connect, that integrates with Celoxis project management software. It allows MCP clients (such as AI chat or other MCP-enabled applications) to interact with Celoxis via its APIs for project and task management.

## Features
- **MCP-compatible endpoint**: Exposes a static MCP server URL (`https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`) that can be used by any compliant client.
- **Celoxis integration**: Connects to Celoxis project management software so clients can work with projects, tasks, and resources through Celoxis APIs.
- **Authentication at client setup**: Uses a shared static server URL; authentication is performed when the server is added to the client/application.
- **Multi-client support**: Designed to work with different MCP-enabled chat clients and applications.
