## Description
DeskTime MCP Server is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server integration for the DeskTime time-tracking platform. It enables MCP-based automation and access to DeskTime’s automatic time tracking, productivity analytics, and activity data from compatible chat clients and applications.

## Features
- **MCP integration for DeskTime**: Exposes DeskTime functionality (time tracking and analytics) via the MCP protocol for use in MCP-compatible clients.
- **Automatic time tracking access**: Interfaces with DeskTime’s fully automatic time tracking capabilities so apps can query or act on tracked time data.
- **Productivity analytics integration**: Provides access to DeskTime productivity metrics and analytics for automation, reporting, or assistant workflows.
- **Activity data access**: Enables retrieval and use of user activity data tracked by DeskTime.
- **Static MCP server endpoint**: Uses a single static MCP server URL (`https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`) that works for all clients.
- **Per-client authentication**: Authentication is handled when adding the server to each application or chat client, rather than via different URLs.
- **Multi-client support**: Can be added to various chat clients or applications that support MCP, allowing DeskTime data to be used across different tools.
- **Configuration via Pipedream**: Setup and configuration are managed through Pipedream’s DeskTime MCP Server configuration page.
