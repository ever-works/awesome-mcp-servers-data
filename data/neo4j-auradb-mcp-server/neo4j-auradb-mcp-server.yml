  ## Overview

  Neo4j AuraDB MCP Server is an MCP-compatible service that connects AI agents
  and MCP clients to a fully managed Neo4j AuraDB graph database. It exposes
  Neo4j AuraDB capabilities through a standard MCP server endpoint so tools and
  chat-based clients can query and manage graph data in a cloud environment.

  - **Static MCP server URL**  
    - Single endpoint for all supported clients:  
      - `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`  
    - URL is client-agnostic; authentication is handled when adding the server to each application.
  - **Client-agnostic configuration**  
    - Works with multiple MCP-compatible chat or agent clients.  
    - Per-client setup instructions available via the configuration flow.
  - **Centralized configuration page**  
    - Dedicated configuration page (on Pipedream) for setup and management of the MCP server connection.
  - **Pipedream-hosted infrastructure**
