# Breezy HR MCP Server

## Overview
The Breezy HR MCP Server is an integration endpoint that connects Breezy HR—a collaborative recruiting and applicant tracking platform—with MCP-compatible applications. It allows you to interact with Breezy HR from chat clients or other tools using a static MCP server URL.

## Features
- **Breezy HR integration via MCP**: Connects Breezy HR’s recruiting and applicant tracking capabilities to MCP-enabled applications.
- **Static MCP server URL**: Use a single URL (`https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`) for all clients; authentication is handled when adding the server to your app.
- **Client-agnostic configuration**: Can be added to multiple chat clients or applications that support MCP.
- **Centralized configuration page**: A configuration page is available to guide setup and usage.
- **Tool-based actions (MCP tools)**: Exposes Breezy HR-related tools/actions through MCP (listed dynamically as “Available tools” in the interface).

*Note: The underlying Breezy HR platform supports job publishing, candidate management, and hiring workflow communication; the MCP server is the integration layer to access these capabilities from MCP-compatible apps.*

## Setup & Configuration
