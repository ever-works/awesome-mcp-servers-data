## Features

- **MCP-compatible server**: Exposes CallPage functionality through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing MCP-based tools and clients to integrate with CallPage.
- **Lead and call generation from websites**: Designed to help tools trigger and manage sales calls and lead capture workflows originating from websites via CallPage’s platform.
- **Static MCP endpoint**: Uses a single, static MCP server URL for all clients:
  - `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`
- **Client-agnostic configuration**: The same endpoint can be added to different MCP-enabled chat clients; authentication and configuration are handled when adding the server in each client.
- **Central configuration docs**: A dedicated configuration page (linked from the app) provides instructions for adding the server to various chat clients.
- **Pipedream Connect integration**: Hosted and operated via Pipedream Connect, enabling use alongside other Pipedream-based integrations.
