  ## Description

  The Dodo Payments MCP Server exposes Dodo Payments’ payment and billing
  capabilities to AI assistants via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It allows
  MCP-compatible clients (such as Claude and Cursor) to securely perform payment
  operations, subscription management, and customer interactions by executing
  TypeScript code against the Dodo Payments SDK in a sandboxed environment.


  ## Features


  ### MCP Integration

  - Implements the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for structured, secure access to
  Dodo Payments APIs.  

  - Compatible with AI assistants and tools that support MCP (e.g., Claude,
  Cursor).  

  - Uses SSE-based MCP connections for communication.


  ### Code Mode Architecture

  - Built with Stainless and uses a **Code Mode** architecture.  

  - AI agents write and execute TypeScript code against the Dodo Payments SDK.  

  - Execution occurs in an isolated sandbox environment.  

  - No web or filesystem access from the sandbox for enhanced security.  

  - Designed for deterministic, repeatable multi-step payment operations.

    - Query Dodo Payments API and SDK documentation.  
    - Discover available operations, parameters, and usage patterns.

  - **Code Execution Tool**  
    - Run TypeScript code snippets using the Dodo Payments SDK.  
    - Perform end-to-end workflows (e.g., create payment, issue refund, update subscription).
