  ## Overview

  Bash MCP Server is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server by Pipedream that
  lets you execute Bash commands inside Pipedream workflows. It supports shell
  scripting and curl-based integrations through a single, reusable MCP endpoint.


  ## Features

  - **Run Bash in workflows**: Execute arbitrary Bash commands as a step within
  Pipedream workflows.

  - **Shell scripting support**: Use standard shell scripting constructs (e.g.,
  piping, environment variables, file operations) within the workflow context.

  - **HTTP and API calls via curl**: Make `curl` requests from Bash to integrate
  with HTTP APIs and external services.

  - **Static MCP server URL**: Uses a single, static MCP endpoint for all
  clients:  
    `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`
  - **Client-agnostic**: The same MCP server URL works for every compatible
  client; integration is handled on the client side.

  - **Authentication at client setup**: Authentication occurs when adding the
  MCP server to your application or chat client.

  - **Workflow integration**: Designed to be used as a step within broader
  Pipedream workflows, combining Bash with other triggers and actions.

  - **Configuration guidance**: Dedicated configuration documentation is
  available via the Pipedream Configuration page.
