**Category:** Database / Messaging MCP Servers  
**Brand:** kvstoreio  
**Slug:** `kvstoreio-mcp-server`

## Description
KVstore.io MCP Server is an MCP Server integration for KVstore.io, providing a simple way to store data on the internet using a key–value store accessed via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It exposes a static MCP server endpoint that can be used by compatible chat or MCP clients to read and write data as key–value pairs.

## Features
- **MCP-compatible key–value storage**: Integrates KVstore.io as a key–value database accessible through the Model Context Protocol.
- **Static MCP server URL**: Uses a single static endpoint for all clients:  
  `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`
- **Per-client authentication**: Authentication is performed when adding the server to an application or client (rather than per-URL customization).
- **Works with multiple chat clients**: Can be added to supported MCP-enabled chat clients to provide persistent storage capabilities.
- **Internet-accessible data store**: Stores and retrieves data over the internet via KVstore.io, suitable for simple, lightweight storage needs.
- **Pipedream-powered integration**: Hosted and operated through Pipedream Connect infrastructure.

## Usage
- Copy and configure the MCP server URL `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2` in your MCP-enabled application or chat client.
- Authenticate within your client when adding the server.
- Use MCP tools/endpoints exposed by the server to store and retrieve key–value data.
