## Overview
ScreenMonitorMCP is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides real-time screen analysis and desktop UI monitoring. It exposes the user’s desktop context to MCP clients, enabling AI systems to visually inspect, understand, and react to on-screen content.

## Features
- **MCP Server for Desktop Context**  
  - Implements a Model Context Protocol server for exposing screen and UI state to MCP-compatible clients.

- **Real-Time Screen Analysis**  
  - Continuously observes the desktop to provide up-to-date visual context.  
  - Designed for "live" interaction with the user interface rather than static screenshots only.

- **UI Monitoring**  
  - Monitors UI elements and on-screen changes to inform AI-driven tools about what is currently visible.  
  - Suitable for building agents that respond to UI events or state changes.

- **AI Vision Integration**  
  - Supports AI-based vision interpretation over the captured screen content.  
  - Enables higher-level understanding of the digital workspace, beyond raw pixels.

- **Context-Aware Recording**  
  - Captures not just the visual content but also contextual information about what’s happening on the screen.  
  - Intended to make it easier for MCP clients to reason about workflows and UI states.

- **Event Hooks**  
  - Provides hooks for events related to screen or UI changes.  
  - Allows MCP clients to subscribe and react programmatically to relevant visual or UI events.

- **Desktop Environment Support**  
  - Built specifically to operate on desktop environments, making the desktop "visible" to AI through MCP.
