  ## Overview

  Graphlit MCP Server is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for the Graphlit
  platform. It ingests content from multiple external sources (such as Slack,
  Discord, websites, Google Drive, Linear, and GitHub) into a Graphlit project
  and exposes that unified data to LLMs via MCP.


  ## Features

  - **MCP server for Graphlit**  
    - Implements the Model Context Protocol to connect Graphlit-hosted data to LLMs.

  - **Multi-source content ingestion**  
    - Ingests and syncs content from:
      - Slack
      - Discord
      - Websites
      - Google Drive
      - Linear
      - GitHub
    - Sends this content into a Graphlit project for centralized access.

  - **LLM-ready knowledge base**  
    - Makes ingested data accessible to LLMs via MCP tools and resources.  
    - Provides a structured way to surface organization knowledge across different systems.

  - **Configurable via environment & project setup**  
    - Uses environment configuration (e.g., `.env.example`) for credentials and connection settings.  
    - Designed to plug into existing Graphlit projects.

  - **Containerization & CI integration**  
    - Includes a `Dockerfile` for containerized deployment.  
    - Includes `azure-pipelines.yml` for CI/CD pipeline configuration.

  - **TypeScript/Node-based implementation**  
    - Distributed as a Node.js project (with `package-lock.json`, formatting configs, etc.).

  - **Open source**  
    - Source code available on GitHub under the MIT license for customization and self-hosting.
