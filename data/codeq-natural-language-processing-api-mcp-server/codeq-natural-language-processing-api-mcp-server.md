# Codeq Natural Language Processing API MCP Server

**Category:** AI Integration – MCP Servers  
**Brand:** codeq  
**Slug:** `codeq-natural-language-processing-api-mcp-server`

## Overview
The Codeq Natural Language Processing API MCP Server is an MCP-compatible integration that exposes the Codeq NLP API through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It enables applications and chat clients to access advanced text understanding and language processing operations via a standardized MCP server endpoint.

## Features
- **MCP server integration** for the Codeq Natural Language Processing (NLP) API.
- **Advanced text understanding** capabilities (e.g., general language processing and text analysis workflows via the underlying Codeq API).
- **Language processing operations over MCP**, allowing tools and clients that support MCP to call the Codeq NLP API in a unified way.
- **Static MCP server URL** usable across different MCP-compatible clients:
  - Server endpoint: `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`
- **Client-agnostic configuration**: same server URL for every client; authentication is handled when adding the server to each application.
- **Integration powered by Pipedream Connect**, leveraging Pipedream’s infrastructure to host and expose the MCP server.

> Note: The page describes the integration but does not list specific NLP endpoints (e.g., sentiment analysis, classification) or detailed operations; those are implied by "advanced text understanding and language processing" provided by the Codeq NLP API.

## MCP Server URL
Use the following MCP server URL in your compatible client:

```text
https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2
```

Authentication is performed when you add the server to your application or chat client.
