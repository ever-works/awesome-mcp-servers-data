## Overview
The IBM X-Force Exchange MCP Server is an integration that exposes IBM X-Force Exchange—IBM’s threat intelligence sharing and research platform—through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It allows MCP-compatible clients and applications to access and work with X-Force threat intelligence data.

## Features
- **MCP-based access to X-Force Exchange**: Integrates IBM X-Force Exchange with any MCP-compatible client or application.
- **Threat intelligence research**: Use the platform to research security threats using X-Force threat intelligence data.
- **Intelligence aggregation**: Aggregate threat intelligence from IBM X-Force Exchange within your MCP-enabled workflows.
- **Collaboration capabilities**: Supports collaboration and intelligence sharing with peers via the X-Force Exchange platform.
- **Static MCP server endpoint**: Single, static MCP server URL for all clients: 
  - `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`
- **Client-agnostic configuration**: The same server URL works across different MCP clients; authentication is performed when adding the server to the application.

## Usage
- Add the MCP server URL (`https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`) to your MCP-compatible chat client or application.
- Authenticate during setup within your chosen client.
- Use the integration to query, aggregate, and collaborate on threat intelligence from IBM X-Force Exchange.
