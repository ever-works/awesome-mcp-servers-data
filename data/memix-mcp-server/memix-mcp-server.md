- **Automated meme generation**: Supports programmatic meme creation from within applications and workflows.
- **Shared static MCP endpoint**: Uses a single static MCP server URL (`https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`) that works across supported clients.
- **Application-level authentication**: Authentication occurs when adding/configuring the server in your application or chat client.
- **Multi-client support**: Can be added to different chat clients and other MCP-aware tools using the same server URL.

## Configuration
- Add the MCP server to your MCP-compatible app or chat client using: `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`.
