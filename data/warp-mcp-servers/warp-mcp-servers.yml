name: Warp MCP Servers
description: Warp’s built-in MCP Servers integration gives you a GUI and
  configuration layer for running, sharing, and authenticating Model Context
  Protocol (MCP) servers directly from the Warp terminal. From the MCP Servers
  page you can start/stop servers, view their tools and resources, rename or
  delete them, and share scrubbed server configurations with teammates. Warp
  also supports multiple authentication methods (environment variables,
  OAuth-based one-click installation, and custom headers) and provides
  out-of-the-box MCP servers that can be installed from the Shared section,
  making it a practical hub for managing and collaborating on MCP servers.
