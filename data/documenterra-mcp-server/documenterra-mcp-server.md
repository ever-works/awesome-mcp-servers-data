## Overview
Documenterra MCP Server is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration for Documenterra, a platform used to create corporate knowledge bases and company documentation sites. This server enables AI agents and MCP-compatible clients to interact with and manage documentation stored in Documenterra.

The MCP server is hosted via Pipedream and exposed through a static URL that can be used by any compatible client.

## Features
- **MCP-based integration:** Exposes Documenterra capabilities through the Model Context Protocol so AI agents and tools can access and manage corporate documentation.
- **Static server URL:** A single, static endpoint usable across all supported MCP clients:
  - MCP server URL: `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`
- **Client-agnostic setup:** The same server URL works for every client that supports MCP; authentication occurs when adding the server to each application.
- **Documentation & configuration reference:** A configuration page (via Pipedream) provides setup details for different chat or MCP clients.
- **Corporate knowledge base support:** Integrates with Documenterra’s system for building and maintaining corporate knowledge bases and company documentation sites, enabling AI-driven access and management.

## Integration & Usage
- Add the MCP server to your MCP-compatible chat client or application using:
  - **Server URL:** `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`
- Authenticate within your chosen client when prompted.
- Refer to the provided configuration documentation (via the "Configuration" page on Pipedream) for client-specific setup steps.
