# CDK MCP Server

**Category:** Cloud & DevOps MCP Servers  
**Brand:** Amazon Web Services (AWS)  
**Website:** https://aws.amazon.com/cdk  
**Source:** AI-focused MCP server for AWS CDK workflows

## Overview

CDK MCP Server exposes AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) capabilities to AI assistants and tools. It enables generation, refinement, and management of infrastructure-as-code (IaC) definitions for AWS using familiar programming languages, following AWS best practices and using current AWS APIs.

## Features

- **Infrastructure as Code with Programming Languages**  
  - Define cloud application resources using general-purpose languages (TypeScript, Python, Java, .NET, and Go in developer preview).  
  - Use the full expressive power of these languages (loops, conditionals, abstractions, typing) to model infrastructure.

- **Construct-based Abstractions**  
  - Use AWS CDK constructs that encapsulate one or more AWS resources.  
  - Simplify onboarding and implementation by using constructs preconfigured with proven defaults and recommended patterns.  
  - Discover and consume community and partner constructs via Construct Hub.

- **Best-practice Defaults and Governance**  
  - Apply constructs that come with security, reliability, and operational best-practice defaults.  
  - Design and share reusable components that encode your organization’s security, compliance, and governance policies.  
  - Support for patterns that align with AWS well-architected practices.

- **AI-assisted CDK Workflows (via MCP)**  
  - Generate initial IaC implementations for AWS services using AWS CDK.  
  - Refine, extend, and review existing CDK stacks and constructs.  
  - Guide assistants to use up-to-date AWS service APIs and CDK versions.  
  - Enable conversational iterations on architecture, security, and configuration choices.

- **IDE-centric Development**  
  - Build applications, write runtime code, and define infrastructure from within the same IDE.  
  - Use language-native tooling (linting, refactoring, code completion) for infrastructure definitions.  
  - Support for workflows like `cdk watch` to speed up the edit-deploy cycle.

- **Application Development & Migration Use Cases**  
  - Use AWS CDK as the main framework to define cloud infrastructure for new applications.  
  - Model and migrate complex backend infrastructures, integrating with CI/CD pipelines for repeatable deployments.  
  - Programmatically create new microservices and supporting infrastructure from constructs and higher-level patterns.

- **Automation & CI/CD Integration**  
  - Integrate generated CDK projects with existing CI/CD systems for automated provisioning and updates.  
  - Support for iterative deployment strategies through CDK stacks and stages.

## Use Cases (MCP-focused)

- Having an AI assistant:
  - Design and scaffold new AWS architectures in CDK.  
  - Translate high-level requirements into concrete CDK stacks and constructs.  
  - Modernize or refactor existing CloudFormation-style IaC into CDK code.  
  - Enforce organizational patterns (e.g., security baselines) via reusable constructs.

## Pricing

- No specific pricing information for the CDK MCP Server is provided in the source content.  
- AWS CDK itself is generally available at no additional charge beyond the cost of underlying AWS resources, but exact pricing details should be confirmed on the AWS site or in AWS documentation.
