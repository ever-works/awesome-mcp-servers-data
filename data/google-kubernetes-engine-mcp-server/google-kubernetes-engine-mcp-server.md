## Overview

Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) MCP Server is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that exposes Google Kubernetes Engine operations to LLM-based tools. It allows language models and MCP-compatible clients to inspect, manage, and troubleshoot Kubernetes clusters running on Google Kubernetes Engine through a structured, API-like interface.

## Features

- **GKE Operations Exposure**  
  - Exposes Google Kubernetes Engine operations via the Model Context Protocol.  
  - Provides programmatic access for LLMs and MCP clients to interact with GKE resources.

- **Cluster Inspection & Introspection**  
  - Read and inspect cluster configurations and state (e.g., nodes, workloads, services, and other Kubernetes resources) on GKE.  
  - Retrieve operational data to support analysis, diagnosis, and reporting by LLM-based tools.

- **Cluster Management Capabilities**  
  - Interfaces for managing Kubernetes clusters hosted on Google Kubernetes Engine (e.g., modifying or orchestrating cluster-level operations via MCP).  
  - Enables LLM tooling to assist with common infrastructure management workflows.

- **Troubleshooting Integration**  
  - Designed to help LLM-based tools troubleshoot issues in Kubernetes clusters on GKE.  
  - Surface relevant operational information and states to support debugging workflows.

- **Model Context Protocol (MCP) Compatibility**  
  - Implements the MCP specification so it can be used with MCP-compatible agents and tools.  
  - Provides a structured, schema-driven interface for interacting with GKE through LLMs.

- **Kubernetes & Cloud Infrastructure Focus**  
  - Targeted specifically at Kubernetes clusters on Google Cloud’s Google Kubernetes Engine.  
  - Suitable for cloud infrastructure automation, DevOps, SRE, and platform engineering use cases where LLMs are part of the tooling stack.
