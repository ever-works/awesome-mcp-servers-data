## Features
- **MCP Server Integration**  
  - Implements the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server role.  
  - Allows MCP-compatible clients to connect and interact with AWS resources.

- **AWS Cloud Control API Backend**  
  - Uses AWS Cloud Control API as the underlying mechanism to manage AWS resources.  
  - Supports a broad, provider-agnostic schema for AWS resource types.

- **Standardized CRUDL Operations**  
  - Provides standardized operations for AWS resources:  
    - Create resources  
    - Read / get resource state  
    - Update existing resources  
    - Delete resources  
    - List resources

- **Comprehensive Resource Management**  
  - Designed for “comprehensive AWS resource CRUDL management,” implying coverage of many AWS resource types supported by Cloud Control API.  
  - Suitable for managing infrastructure-as-code–style workflows via MCP.

- **Infrastructure as Code & Resource Management Focus**  
  - Targets use cases around infrastructure-as-code, resource provisioning, and configuration management.  
  - Enables programmatic, declarative-like control of AWS resources from MCP-aware tools.

- **Integrated Security Scanning**  
  - Includes integrated security scanning capabilities for managed AWS resources (e.g., to identify misconfigurations or policy issues).  
  - Surfaces security-related findings through the same MCP interface.

- **Standardized MCP Resource Interface**  
  - Exposes AWS resource operations in a standardized way consistent with MCP conventions.  
  - Helps unify AWS operations with other MCP servers/resources inside a single client or agent.
