  # RudderStack HTTP MCP Server


  ## Overview

  RudderStack HTTP MCP Server exposes the RudderStack HTTP API as a Model
  Context Protocol (MCP) server. It allows MCP-compatible clients to send
  customer event data from various sources into RudderStack, which then routes
  that data to configured destinations in your customer data platform stack.

  ## Features

  - **RudderStack HTTP API access via MCP**  
    - Exposes the RudderStack HTTP API through an MCP server interface.  
    - Enables MCP clients (e.g., AI/chat applications that support MCP) to send events programmatically.

  - **Customer event data ingestion**  
    - Accepts event data from multiple sources via the HTTP endpoint.  
    - Supports sending customer behavior and tracking events into RudderStack’s customer data platform.

  - **Routing to configured destinations**  
    - Forwards ingested event data from RudderStack to your configured downstream tools and destinations (e.g., analytics, warehouses, marketing tools) according to your RudderStack setup.

  - **Static MCP server URL**  
    - Uses a single, static endpoint for all clients:  
      - `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`  
    - The same URL is used across clients, simplifying configuration.

  - **Per-client authentication**  
    - Authentication is performed when adding the server to each application or MCP-compatible client (credentials and method configured within the client).

  - **Client-agnostic integration**  
    - Designed to work with any MCP-capable chat or application client.  
    - Can be added to supported chat clients to enable event sending from within those environments.

  - **Configuration documentation**  
    - Additional setup and configuration details are available through a dedicated configuration page linked from the app.
