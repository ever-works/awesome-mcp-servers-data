  ## Features


  - **MCP-compatible server:** Exposes Jibble time tracking functionality
  through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing integration with MCP‑aware
  AI/chat clients.

  - **Static server URL:** Uses a single, static MCP server endpoint that works
  across all supported clients:
    - `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`
  - **Per-client authentication:** The URL is universal, while authentication is
  handled when adding the server inside each specific application or chat
  client.

  - **Time tracking integration:** Connects to Jibble’s time tracking platform
  so AI tools and workflows can leverage time tracking and related
  workforce/operations data (e.g., for time tracking and workforce management
  use cases).

  - **Pipedream Connect integration:** Hosted and powered by Pipedream Connect,
  making it part of the broader Pipedream integration ecosystem.

  - **Configuration guidance:** A dedicated configuration page (linked from the
  product page) provides instructions for adding the server to various chat
  clients.
