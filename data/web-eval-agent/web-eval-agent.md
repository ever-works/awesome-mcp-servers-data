## Description
web-eval-agent is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that autonomously evaluates and debugs web applications. It uses browser-based, agent-style automation to run diagnostic and evaluation flows directly in a real browser environment.

## Features
- **MCP Server Implementation**  
  - Implements a server compatible with operative.sh’s MCP ecosystem.  
  - Exposes tools that can be driven by AI coding agents.

- **Autonomous Web App Evaluation**  
  - Automatically launches a browser session to interact with target web applications.  
  - Executes evaluation flows to check application behavior and state.

- **Browser-Based Diagnostic Agent**  
  - Uses a "browser-use" style agent to perform actions inside the browser (e.g., navigation, interaction, observation).  
  - Designed to help an AI coding agent debug web applications by running tests and collecting evidence directly from the UI.

- **Automation-Oriented Design**  
  - Intended to be run as part of automated debugging or evaluation pipelines.  
  - Integrates with other MCP-compatible tools and agents.

- **Python Project Setup**  
  - Distributed as a Python package (pyproject.toml, requirements.txt included).  
  - Comes with configuration files for development tooling (pre-commit, .gitignore) and dependency locking.

- **Open Source Licensing**  
  - Includes a LICENSE file (see repository for specific license terms).
