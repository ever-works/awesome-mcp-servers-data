## Description
The Modelry MCP Server is an integration that connects MCP-compatible clients (such as chat-based tools or applications) to the Modelry 3D modeling platform. It enables ordering, reviewing, and publishing 3D models through a unified MCP endpoint.

## Features
- **Unified MCP Endpoint**  
  - Provides a single static MCP server URL: `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`  
  - Same URL works across all supported MCP clients.

- **Modelry Platform Integration**  
  - Connects to a Modelry account to interact with 3D modeling workflows.  
  - Designed to streamline ordering, reviewing, and publishing 3D models from one platform.

- **Client-Agnostic Setup**  
  - Can be added to multiple MCP-compatible chat or app clients.  
  - Client-specific setup instructions are available via the configuration flow.

- **Account-Based Access**  
  - Connects to your Modelry account before use.  
  - Authentication occurs when you add the server to your application.

- **Configuration Guidance**  
  - A dedicated configuration page ("Configuration" on Pipedream) provides full setup details.  
  - In-app flow for checking your account and selecting the client.

- **Tool Discovery (MCP Tools)**  
  - Exposes Modelry-related actions as MCP tools (loaded dynamically as "available tools").  
  - Tools are discoverable and usable from compatible MCP clients once the server is added.

## Technical Details
