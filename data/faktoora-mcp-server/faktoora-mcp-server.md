## Description
faktoora MCP Server is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server integration that connects MCP‑compatible tools and chat clients to faktoora’s invoicing platform.

- **No-IT invoicing setup**: Intended for use without requiring internal IT expertise to manage or deploy the invoicing integration.
