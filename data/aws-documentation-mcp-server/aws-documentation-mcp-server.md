## Overview

AWS Documentation MCP Server is an MCP-compatible server that allows AI assistants and tools to query the latest official AWS documentation. It is designed for building coding assistants and automated workflows that need up‑to‑date AWS API references, examples, and service guidance directly from AWS docs.

## Features

- **Access to latest AWS documentation**  
  Connects AI assistants to current AWS service documentation so generated code and guidance reflect the latest APIs and features.

- **Service-wide coverage**  
  Supports research across any AWS service that has official AWS documentation (e.g., compute, storage, databases, networking, security, AI/ML, and more).

- **API reference lookup**  
  Enables retrieval of detailed API references, parameters, request/response formats, and usage notes for AWS services.

- **Code example discovery**  
  Surfaces examples from AWS docs to help generate or validate code snippets in common languages supported by AWS documentation.

- **Guidance and best practices**  
  Allows assistants to pull conceptual guides, how‑to pages, and patterns from AWS documentation to inform explanations and recommendations.

- **MCP server integration**  
  Exposes AWS documentation as tools/endpoints through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), making it straightforward to integrate into AI assistants and developer workflows.

- **Supports coding assistants & workflows**  
  Optimized for use in IDE plugins, chat-based coding assistants, and automation workflows that must stay aligned with current AWS docs.

## Use Cases

- Building AI coding assistants specialized in AWS services
