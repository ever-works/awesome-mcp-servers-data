## Overview
Kizeo Forms MCP Server integrates the Kizeo mobile forms application with the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It enables MCP-compatible clients (such as chat-based tools) to work with mobile forms for data collection and form-based workflows.

## Features
- **MCP integration endpoint**  
  - Provides a static MCP server URL usable across compatible clients:  
    - `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`
  - Designed to be added as a server within any MCP-enabled application.

- **Mobile forms integration**  
  - Connects MCP clients to Kizeo’s mobile forms application.  
  - Supports scenarios such as creating and managing mobile forms and collecting data through those forms (as described in the item metadata).

- **Client-agnostic setup**  
  - Same server URL works for multiple chat or MCP clients.  
  - Authentication is handled when adding the server inside the client application.

- **Configuration resources**  
  - Documentation and setup details available via a central Configuration page on Pipedream.

## Authentication
- Authentication occurs when you add the MCP server to your chosen client application.  
- No additional per-client server URL is required; all clients use `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`.
