## Features

- **Direct File System Access:** Grants LLMs the ability to read, write, create, move, and search files and directories on your local machine.
- **Secure and Controlled:** Only accesses directories explicitly authorized by the user; all operations require user permission.
- **Natural Language File Management:** Allows users to manage files and directories using conversational commands (e.g., organize files, create directories, move documents).
- **Content Creation & Editing:** Enables the AI to write new documents, edit existing files, and create templates or reports directly on your file system.
- **Batch Operations:** Supports batch creation and editing of multiple files.
- **Comprehensive File Operations:**
  - `read_file`: Read contents of a file
  - `read_multiple_files`: Read multiple files at once
  - `list_directory`: List contents of a directory
  - `search_files`: Recursively search for files
  - `get_file_info`: Retrieve file metadata
  - `write_file`: Create or overwrite files
  - `edit_file`: Edit files using pattern matching
  - `create_directory`: Create new directories
  - `move_file`: Move or rename files and directories
- **Advanced Configuration:**
  - Grant read-only access to specific directories (e.g., via Docker with the `ro` flag)
  - Run the Filesystem MCP server in a Docker container for enhanced security and isolation
- **Developer Support:** Works with Claude Desktop application (macOS and Windows), configured via a JSON file.
- **Security Best Practices:**
  - Limit accessible directories
  - Use read-only access for sensitive folders
  - Review and approve all file operations
  - Avoid granting access to highly sensitive data
  - Regularly audit accessible directories
- **Troubleshooting:** Guides for addressing common issues like server visibility, permission errors, configuration problems, and connectivity.

## Practical Applications
