# Sellercloud MCP Server

## Overview
Sellercloud MCP Server connects Sellercloud’s omnichannel e-commerce platform to MCP-compatible applications, allowing agents and tools to manage products, orders, and sales channels programmatically.

## Features
- **MCP integration endpoint**: Provides a static MCP server URL (`https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`) that can be used across clients.
- **Authentication at app level**: Authentication is handled when adding the server to your MCP-compatible application, rather than requiring different URLs per client.
- **Omnichannel e-commerce support**: Designed to work with Sellercloud’s platform for managing multi-channel online retail operations.
- **Programmatic agent access**: Allows MCP agents to interact with Sellercloud resources (e.g., products, orders, channels) through MCP tools and actions.
- **Client-agnostic setup**: The same server URL works for every MCP client, simplifying configuration.

> Note: The page references “Available tools” and “Loading actions…”, but specific tool names or capabilities are not listed in the provided content.
