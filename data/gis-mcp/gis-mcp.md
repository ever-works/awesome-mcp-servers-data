## Description

`gis-mcp` is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that connects Large Language Models (LLMs) to GIS (Geographic Information Systems) libraries. It enables AI assistants and other MCP-compatible clients to perform geospatial analyses, spatial transformations, and location-based workflows through standardized MCP tools.

## Features

- **MCP Server for GIS**  
  - Implements a Model Context Protocol server focused on geospatial capabilities.  
  - Exposes GIS operations as MCP tools that LLMs and MCP clients can call.

- **Integration with LLMs**  
  - Connects Large Language Models to GIS operations so they can request geospatial analyses programmatically.  
  - Designed for AI assistants and agentic workflows that need spatial data handling.

- **Geospatial Operations & Transformations**  
  - Uses GIS libraries (details in repo) to perform spatial calculations and transformations.  
  - Supports location-based workflows such as analyzing, transforming, and querying spatial data.

- **Location-Based Workflows**  
  - Enables automated workflows that involve geographic locations and spatial relationships.  
  - Suitable for tasks like spatial analysis, mapping-related operations, and other GIS-driven pipelines.

- **Extensible Codebase**  
  - Organized source under `src/gis_mcp` for core server logic.  
  - `agents` directory for AI/agent examples or integrations.  
  - `tests` directory for automated testing and validation.

- **Documentation & Examples**  
  - `docs` directory and `mkdocs.yml` indicate a structured documentation site.  
  - Example configurations and usage guidance are available in the repository and project site.

- **Containerization & Deployment**  
  - `Dockerfile` and `Dockerfile.local` for container-based deployment and local development.  
  - Suitable for running as a standalone service within an MCP ecosystem.

- **Ecosystem & Compatibility**  
  - Built specifically for the MCP ecosystem, allowing interoperable tools and LLM clients.  
  - Can be integrated into broader AI stacks that support MCP servers.
