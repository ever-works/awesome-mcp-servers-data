  # TickTick MCP Server


  ## Overview

  The TickTick MCP Server exposes TickTick’s task and productivity modules to
  MCP-based AI clients and workflows. It lets you connect a TickTick account and
  control tasks and projects directly from compatible chat or MCP-enabled
  applications.


  - **Category:** Project Management MCP Server

  - **Provider / Brand:** Pipedream

  - **Integrates with:** TickTick

  - **MCP Endpoint:** `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`


  ## Features


  ### MCP Integration

  - Static MCP server URL (`https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`) usable across
  supported MCP clients.

  - Authentication handled when adding the server to an MCP-enabled application.

  - Configuration guidance available for multiple chat clients (e.g., ChatGPT /
  OpenAI) via Pipedream’s configuration docs.


  ### TickTick Capabilities Exposed

  The server surfaces core TickTick modules and data for AI workflows,
  including:

  - Tasks

  - Calendar

  - Eisenhower Matrix

  - Pomodoro

  - Habit Tracker


  > Note: The UI and description explicitly mention these modules as part of
  TickTick; the current MCP tools focus on task and project operations.


  ### Available Tools (Actions)

  The following actions are available as tools in MCP-compatible clients:


  1. **Create a Task**  
     - Create a new task in a connected TickTick account.

  2. **Update a Task**

  3. **Complete a Task**  
     - Mark an existing TickTick task as completed.

  4. **List Projects**  
     - Retrieve all projects in a TickTick account.

  These tools allow AI agents or workflows to programmatically manage tasks and
  projects within TickTick.
