  # XMind MCP Server


  ## Description

  A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for analyzing and querying XMind mind
  map files. It allows LLMs and MCP-compatible clients (such as Claude Desktop)
  to read, search, and extract information from directories of XMind-based
  knowledge structures.


  ## Features

  - **XMind mind map analysis and querying**  
    - Works with XMind `.xmind` files as structured knowledge sources.
  - **Directory-level operations**  
    - `list_xmind_directory`: list XMind files within a directory so clients can discover available maps.
  - **File reading and aggregation**  
    - `read_xmind`: read and parse a single XMind file.  
    - `read_multiple_xmind_files`: load and analyze multiple XMind files in one request.
  - **Task and TODO extraction**  
    - `get_todo_tasks`: extract tasks or TODO-style items from XMind maps.
  - **Search capabilities**  
    - `search_xmind_files`: search across XMind files for matching content.  
    - `search_nodes`: search within nodes of a map for specific text or criteria.
  - **Node-level extraction**  
    - `extract_node`: extract a specific node and its content from a map.  
    - `extract_node_by_id`: retrieve a node by its internal ID, enabling precise programmatic access.
  - **MCP integration**  
    - Exposes the above operations as MCP tools, so LLMs can programmatically browse, query, and analyze XMind-based knowledge during a conversation.

  ## Installation

  - **Via Smithery**: can be installed for Claude Desktop using Smithery
  (`smithery.ai`) as an MCP server.  

  - **Manual installation**: supports manual setup (e.g., via Node.js/TypeScript
  environment) as described in the project’s README.


  ## Usage

  - Run as an MCP server and register it in `claude_desktop_config.json` for
  either development or production setups.

  - Provides tools (`read_xmind`, `search_xmind_files`, `extract_node`, etc.)
  that can be invoked from MCP-compatible clients.


  ## Technical Details

  - Implemented in **TypeScript** (see `index.ts`, `tsconfig.json`,
  `package.json`).

  - Distributed as a GitHub repository (`apeyroux/mcp-xmind`).


  ## Pricing

  - Pricing is **not specified** in the available content. The project is
  distributed as an open-source GitHub repository; refer to the repository for
  license and usage terms.
