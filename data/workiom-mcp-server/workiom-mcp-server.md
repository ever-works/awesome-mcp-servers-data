## Description
The Workiom MCP Server exposes Workiom—a no-code data and task management platform—as a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server. It allows MCP-compatible clients (such as chat-based or agent-style applications) to access, automate, and collaborate on data and tasks stored in Workiom.

## Features
- **MCP-compatible server endpoint**  
  - Static MCP server URL: `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`  
  - Can be added to any compatible MCP client or chat application.

- **Workiom integration**  
  - Connects to a Workiom account for data and task management.  
  - Uses Workiom as a backend for business and work management scenarios.

- **No-code data & task management**  
  - Designed for teams and companies to manage structured data and tasks.  
  - Suitable for business and work management workflows without custom code.

- **Automation support**  
  - Enables automation of operations on Workiom-stored data and tasks via MCP tools/actions.  
  - Intended to streamline repetitive workflows in Workiom.

- **Collaboration capabilities (via Workiom)**  
  - Leverages Workiom’s collaboration features for shared data and task management.  
  - Aims at team-based usage and business management contexts.

- **Tool-based interaction**  
  - Exposes Workiom capabilities as “tools” or “actions” within MCP clients.  
  - Tools are discoverable and can be invoked from compatible chat or agent interfaces.

- **Centralized configuration**  
  - Configure once by connecting your Workiom account.  
  - Same static MCP URL works across different clients; authentication occurs when the server is added to the client.
