## Overview
AWS CloudFormation MCP Server is an MCP-compatible server that enables assistants and tools to manage Amazon CloudFormation stacks and resources programmatically. It leverages the AWS Cloud Control API to provide direct, structured access to CloudFormation-managed infrastructure within the Model Context Protocol ecosystem.

## Features
- **Direct CloudFormation integration**  
  - Connects to AWS CloudFormation via the AWS Cloud Control API.  
  - Provides programmatic access to CloudFormation stacks and underlying resources.

- **MCP server compatibility**  
  - Exposes CloudFormation operations as MCP tools/resources for use by MCP clients (e.g., AI assistants, automations).  
  - Integrates into the broader MCP architecture for unified tool orchestration.

- **Stack management**  
  - Supports creating, updating, and managing CloudFormation stacks programmatically.  
  - Intended for infrastructure-as-code workflows where stack definitions are versioned and automated.

- **Resource-level control**  
  - Enables querying and interacting with CloudFormation-managed resources, not just stacks.  
  - Useful for inspection, reconciliation, and fine-grained infrastructure operations.

- **Infrastructure-as-code alignment**  
  - Designed for IaC workflows using AWS CloudFormation.  
  - Facilitates automated management of infrastructure definitions and deployments from within MCP-aware tooling.
