  # AWS CloudFormation MCP Server


  **Category:** Cloud & DevOps MCP Servers  

  **Brand:** Amazon Web Services (AWS)  

  **Website:** https://modelcontextprotocol.io/mcp/servers/cfn-mcp-server


  ## Overview

  AWS CloudFormation MCP Server is an MCP-compatible server that enables
  assistants and tools to manage Amazon CloudFormation stacks and resources
  programmatically. It leverages the AWS Cloud Control API to provide direct,
  structured access to CloudFormation-managed infrastructure within the Model
  Context Protocol ecosystem.


  ## Features

  - **Direct CloudFormation integration**  
    - Connects to AWS CloudFormation via the AWS Cloud Control API.  
    - Provides programmatic access to CloudFormation stacks and underlying resources.

  - **MCP server compatibility**  
    - Exposes CloudFormation operations as MCP tools/resources for use by MCP clients (e.g., AI assistants, automations).  
    - Integrates into the broader MCP architecture for unified tool orchestration.

  - **Stack management**  
    - Supports creating, updating, and managing CloudFormation stacks programmatically.  
    - Intended for infrastructure-as-code workflows where stack definitions are versioned and automated.

  - **Resource-level control**  
    - Enables querying and interacting with CloudFormation-managed resources, not just stacks.  
    - Useful for inspection, reconciliation, and fine-grained infrastructure operations.

  - **Infrastructure-as-code alignment**  
    - Designed for IaC workflows using AWS CloudFormation.  
    - Facilitates automated management of infrastructure definitions and deployments from within MCP-aware tooling.
