# Amazon CloudWatch MCP Server

## Overview
Amazon CloudWatch MCP Server is an AI-powered Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that integrates with Amazon CloudWatch to simplify monitoring and troubleshooting of distributed applications. It brings CloudWatch observability data (metrics, alarms, and logs) into MCP-compatible workflows to support faster, more automated operational analysis.

- **Type:** Observability / Monitoring MCP server
- **Category:** Monitoring
- **Ecosystem:** AWS / Amazon CloudWatch
- **Use cases:** Operational troubleshooting, incident response, observability analysis for distributed and mission-critical applications

## Features

### AI-Powered Observability
- Integrates Amazon CloudWatch metrics, alarms, and logs into MCP workflows.
- Uses AI/ML-style analysis to assist with troubleshooting and operational decision-making.
- Designed to scale with high-volume telemetry from distributed and dynamic systems.

### Alarm-Based Troubleshooting
- Identifies currently active CloudWatch alarms.
- Retrieves related metrics and logs associated with those alarms.
- Analyzes historical alarm patterns to help determine likely root causes of triggered alerts.
- Generates context-aware recommendations to guide remediation steps.

### Log Analysis
- Connects to CloudWatch log groups for automated inspection.
- Analyzes logs to detect anomalies and notable message patterns.
- Supports log-centric troubleshooting as part of an MCP-based workflow (e.g., from an AI assistant or tool that speaks MCP).

### MCP Integration
- Implements Model Context Protocol (MCP) so AI agents and tools can programmatically:
  - Discover available observability actions.
  - Request alarm, metric, and log analyses through a standardized interface.
  - Incorporate observability insights directly into broader automation or assistant experiences.
