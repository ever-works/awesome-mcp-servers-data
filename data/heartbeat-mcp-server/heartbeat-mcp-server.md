## Overview
Heartbeat MCP Server is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server endpoint provided by Pipedream for integrating Heartbeat-based online communities into compatible chat clients and applications. It offers a static MCP server URL that can be added to any supported client, where authentication is handled during server setup in the client.

## Features
- **Static MCP server endpoint**  
  - Single universal URL for all clients:  
    `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`
  - Same endpoint used across different MCP-compatible chat clients and tools.

- **Client-agnostic integration**  
  - Designed to be added to a variety of chat clients / MCP-enabled applications.  
  - Configuration performed on the client side after adding the server.

- **Authentication on add**  
  - Authentication is performed when the server is added to the client, rather than requiring per-request configuration.

- **Configuration guidance**  
  - Setup instructions available via a dedicated Configuration page (not client-specific in the server itself, but referenced for use).

- **Pipedream Connect infrastructure**  
  - Powered by Pipedream Connect, leveraging Pipedream’s underlying integration platform.

## How It’s Used
- Add the MCP server URL `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2` to an MCP-compatible chat client or app.
- Complete authentication when prompted by the client during setup.
- Use the client’s interface to interact with Heartbeat-related community workflows and data via the MCP server.
