  ## Description

  The commercetools MCP Server provides an MCP-compatible interface to
  commercetools’ modern commerce platform. It allows clients that support the
  Model Context Protocol (MCP) to interact with commercetools APIs through a
  single, static server endpoint.


  ## Features

  - **MCP-compatible server**: Exposes commercetools functionality via the Model
  Context Protocol.

  - **Static server URL**: Uses a single endpoint
  (`https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`) for all MCP clients.

  - **Authentication at client setup**: Authentication is handled when you add
  the server to your MCP-enabled application.

  - **MACH-based commerce backend**: Integrates with a modern commerce platform
  based on MACH principles (microservices, API-first, cloud-native, headless).

  - **Client-agnostic integration**: Designed to work with any MCP-capable chat
  or agent client using the same URL.

  - **Configuration guidance available**: Full configuration instructions are
  provided via the linked configuration page on the host site.


  ## Integration & Usage

  - Add the MCP server URL `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2` to your supported MCP
  client or chat application.

  client-specific setup steps.
