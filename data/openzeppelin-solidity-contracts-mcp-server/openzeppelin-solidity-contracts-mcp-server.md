## Overview

The OpenZeppelin Solidity Contracts MCP Server is a remote MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that plugs OpenZeppelin’s audited Solidity contracts and style rules into AI-driven development environments (e.g., Cursor, Claude, Gemini, Windsurf, VS Code). It replaces raw AI code output with OpenZeppelin-standard implementations, enabling predictable, production-ready smart contracts directly from AI prompts.

## Features

### MCP-Based Smart Contract Generation
- Server-based engine that integrates with AI coding tools via MCP.
- Replaces generic AI output with OpenZeppelin-approved contract schemes.
- Ensures generated contracts follow OpenZeppelin security and style guidelines.
- Produces predictable, verified, production-ready Solidity code from AI prompts.

### 8 Specialized Smart Contract Tools
1. **`solidity-erc20`**  
   - Generates ERC-20 fungible token contracts.  
   - Uses widely adopted ERC token standards.

2. **`solidity-erc721`**  
   - Generates ERC-721 non-fungible token (NFT) contracts.

3. **`solidity-erc1155`**  
   - Generates ERC-1155 multi-token contracts (fungible and non-fungible).

4. **`solidity-stablecoin`**  
   - Experimental stablecoin implementations.  
   - ERC-20 compliant.

5. **`solidity-rwa`**  
   - Contracts for tokenizing real-world assets.

6. **`solidity-account`**  
   - ERC-4337 account abstraction contracts.

7. **`solidity-governor`**  
   - DAO governance contract implementations.

8. **`solidity-custom`**  
   - Custom smart contract generation using OpenZeppelin patterns.

### Automated Security & Style Enforcement
- Validates generated code against the same rule set as OpenZeppelin Contracts Wizard.
- Automatically enforces:
  - Proper imports.
  - Modifiers and access control patterns.
  - Naming conventions.
  - Security checks and best practices.
- Aims to reduce common vulnerabilities and deviations from standard patterns.

### Integration & Workflow
- Designed for AI-assisted development tools (Cursor, Claude, Gemini, Windsurf, VS Code, and others).
- Standardizes smart contract generation across different AI platforms.
- Allows rapid prototyping of tokenomics, DeFi mechanisms, and governance systems.

### Update & Compatibility Behavior
- New templates added to OpenZeppelin’s Contracts Wizard become available via MCP automatically (no user-side configuration required).
- Supports multiple environments:
  - EVM-compatible chains.  
  - Arbitrum Stylus.  
  - Starknet.  
  - Stellar environments.

## Use Cases

- **Blockchain Developers & Smart Contract Engineers**
  - Generate production-ready contracts with built-in security patterns.
  - Maintain OpenZeppelin standards while reducing development time.
  - Rapidly experiment with DeFi and tokenomics designs.

- **DeFi Protocol Builders**
  - Implement governance tokens and DAO governance contracts.
  - Build stablecoin implementations and real-world asset tokenization.
  - Create account abstraction–based UX flows (ERC-4337).

- **Web3 Startups & Enterprises**
  - Accelerate development cycles for production smart contracts.
  - Align implementations with widely accepted industry best practices.
  - Leverage a battle-tested library instead of ad hoc code.

- **Educational Institutions & Bootcamps**
  - Teach Solidity using standard, audited contract patterns.
  - Provide students with secure, example-based contract templates.
  - Demonstrate real-world security and design best practices.
