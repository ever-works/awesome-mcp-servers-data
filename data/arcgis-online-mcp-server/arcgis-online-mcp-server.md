## Overview
The ArcGIS Online MCP Server exposes ArcGIS Online’s mapping and spatial analysis capabilities through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing AI tools and chat-based clients to interact with maps, geospatial data, and spatial analysis workflows.

## Features
- **MCP endpoint for ArcGIS Online**: Provides a static MCP server URL (`https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`) that can be used across compatible MCP clients.
- **Interactive mapping integration**: Enables AI tools and applications to work with interactive maps that connect people, locations, and data.
- **Geospatial data access**: Facilitates interaction with geospatial datasets hosted in ArcGIS Online.
- **Smart, data‑driven styling**: Supports the use of data‑driven map styles for visualizing spatial data.
- **Spatial analysis tools**: Exposes ArcGIS Online spatial analysis capabilities so they can be orchestrated via MCP-aware clients.
- **Sharing and collaboration**: Supports workflows where map insights can be shared with the world or restricted to specific groups (as enabled by ArcGIS Online).
- **Client-agnostic configuration**: The same MCP server URL works for all clients, with authentication handled when the server is added to each application.
- **Configuration guidance**: Integrates with Pipedream Connect’s configuration flow and documentation (via the Configuration page) for setup in supported chat clients.

## Usage
- Add the MCP server URL `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2` to your MCP-compatible chat or AI client.
- Authenticate to ArcGIS Online when prompted by your client during server setup.
- Use the client’s tools/commands to query maps, geospatial data, and run spatial analysis operations exposed through the MCP server.
