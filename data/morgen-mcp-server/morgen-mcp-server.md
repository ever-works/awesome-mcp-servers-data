# Morgen MCP Server

**Category:** Project Management MCP Servers  
**Website:** https://mcp.pipedream.com/app/morgen

An MCP Server integration for Morgen that lets MCP-compatible clients interact with your calendar data and daily planning workflows.

## Features

- **MCP-based calendar access**: Exposes Morgen calendar data via the Model Context Protocol (MCP), so MCP-enabled chat or AI clients can work with your schedule.
- **Daily planning workflows**: Designed around daily planning use cases (e.g., reviewing, organizing, and interacting with events and tasks in your calendars).
- **Static server endpoint**: Uses a single, static MCP server URL that works across clients:
  - `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`
- **Client-agnostic setup**: The same server URL can be added to any compatible MCP client or chat application.
- **Authentication at client level**: Authentication is handled when you add the server to your MCP-compatible application (no client-specific URL needed).
- **Configuration documentation**: A full configuration page is available for step-by-step setup across different clients.
