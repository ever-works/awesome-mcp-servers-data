## Features

- **MCP-compatible Strava integration**  
  Connects Strava’s platform to any client or tool that supports the Model Context Protocol (MCP), enabling programmatic access to athlete activity and training data.

- **Unified static server URL**  
  Uses a single, static MCP endpoint for all clients:  
  `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`  
  This URL is shared across supported MCP clients, simplifying configuration.

- **Client-agnostic setup**  
  Designed to be added to multiple MCP-capable chat clients and applications; you authenticate when adding the server in your chosen client.

- **Strava activity data access**  
  Built around Strava’s ecosystem for runners and cyclists, enabling tools to work with training and activity information (e.g., runs, rides, and related metrics), subject to Strava’s permissions and APIs.

- **Configuration documentation**  
  A dedicated configuration page (linked from the app) provides setup instructions for supported clients and details on adding the server to your app.

- **Hosted by Pipedream Connect**  
  The server is operated through Pipedream’s infrastructure, so you don’t need to self-host the MCP server.
