## Features

- **MCP interface for PokéAPI**  
  Exposes the PokéAPI (a RESTful Pokémon data API) via the Model Context Protocol (MCP), so MCP-enabled tools and chat clients can access Pokémon data as structured tool calls.

- **Static MCP server URL**  
  Uses a single static MCP endpoint for all clients:  
  `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`

- **Client-agnostic setup**  
  The same MCP URL works with any compatible chat client or application; authentication is handled when you add the server to your app.

- **Configuration guidance**  
  Supports setup via client-specific instructions and a central configuration page (through Pipedream Connect) for integrating the server into different environments.

- **Hosted by Pipedream**  
  Runs on Pipedream’s MCP infrastructure, so you don’t need to self-host the PokéAPI integration.
