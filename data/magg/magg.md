# Magg

**Category:** MCP Middleware & Orchestration  
**Website/Source:** https://github.com/sitbon/magg  
**Description:** Magg is a meta‑MCP server that acts as a universal hub for Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools, enabling LLMs to autonomously discover, install, and orchestrate multiple MCP servers from a single centralized system.

## Features

- **Meta-MCP Aggregator**
  - Operates as a meta‑MCP server on top of the Model Context Protocol.
  - Exposes a unified interface to multiple downstream MCP servers.

- **Centralized Hub for MCP Tools**
  - Serves as a single hub through which LLMs can access many MCP tools.
  - Simplifies management of multiple MCP servers via one central system.

- **Tool Discovery & Installation**
  - Enables autonomous discovery of available MCP tools/servers.
  - Supports automatic or assisted installation of MCP servers for use by LLMs.

- **Orchestration of Multiple MCP Servers**
  - Coordinates calls across several MCP servers from one entry point.
  - Allows LLMs to use and combine tools from different MCP backends.

- **LLM-Focused Integration**
  - Designed so large language models can interact with MCP tools through Magg rather than dealing with each server individually.
  - Supports autonomous behavior patterns where an LLM can select, install, and use tools dynamically.

- **Python Package Distribution**
  - Available as a Python package on PyPI (`magg`).
  - Can be integrated into Python-based MCP or LLM tooling ecosystems.
