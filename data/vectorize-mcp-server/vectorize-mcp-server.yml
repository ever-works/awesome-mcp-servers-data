  ## Description

  Vectorize MCP Server is an open-source implementation of a Model Context
  Protocol (MCP) server that integrates with the Vectorize platform. It is
  designed to enable advanced semantic search and retrieval using natural
  language queries and is optimized for performance on large-scale vector
  datasets. The server supports efficient similarity matching using Approximate
  Nearest Neighbors algorithms and offers a range of customizable parameters for
  vector operations.


  ## Features

  - **Semantic Search & Retrieval:** Supports natural language queries to
  retrieve relevant documents or data from vector databases.

  - **Integration with Vectorize:** Works with the Vectorize platform for
  advanced vector-based operations.

  - **Approximate Nearest Neighbors Algorithms:** Utilizes efficient algorithms
  for similarity matching in large datasets.

  - **Customizable Parameters:** Allows configuration of result counts and other
  retrieval options.

  - **Text Extraction & Chunking:** Can extract text from documents (e.g., PDFs)
  and chunk them into Markdown format.

  - **Deep Research:** Supports generating private deep research reports from
  pipelines, including optional web search.

  - **API Tools:** Provides API endpoints for retrieve, extract, and
  deep-research operations.

  - **VS Code Integration:** Supports one-click and manual installation for
  integration with VS Code and other editors (Claude, Windsurf, Cursor, Cline).

  - **Open Source:** Licensed under MIT, with source code and contributions
  managed via GitHub.


  ## Installation & Configuration

  - **NPM/NPX:** Can be run directly via npx or installed via npm.

  - **Environment Variables:** Requires setting organization ID, token, and
  pipeline ID for operation.

  - **VS Code & Editor Config:** Provides JSON configuration snippets for easy
  setup in various editors.


  ## Development

  - Standard npm-based development workflow (install, run dev, release
  management).

  - Contributions via GitHub pull requests.


  ## Pricing

  - **Open Source:** No pricing; available under the MIT license.
