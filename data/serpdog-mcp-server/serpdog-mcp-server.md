## Description
Serpdog MCP Server is a Pipedream-hosted Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that exposes the Serpdog Google Search API. It provides programmatic access to real-time Google Search results via an API that handles proxies and CAPTCHAs, enabling smooth, automated web search and scraping workflows from compatible MCP clients.

## Features
- **Real-time Google Search results**: Query live Google Search and retrieve up-to-date results programmatically.
- **Proxy and CAPTCHA handling**: Offloads proxy management and CAPTCHA solving to the API for more reliable scraping.
- **Unified static MCP endpoint**: Uses a single MCP server URL (`https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`) that works across compatible clients.
- **MCP integration**: Designed to be added as an MCP server to chat or developer tools that support the Model Context Protocol.
- **Authentication at client setup**: Authentication is performed when you add the server to your application, rather than per-URL configuration.
- **Hosted by Pipedream**: Operates on Pipedream’s infrastructure, leveraging Pipedream Connect for connectivity and configuration.

## Integration & Setup
- Add `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2` as an MCP server in your supported chat client or tool.
- Configure authentication and options following the client’s instructions or the Pipedream Configuration page.
