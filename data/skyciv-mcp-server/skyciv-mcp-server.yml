  ## SkyCiv MCP Server


  **Category:** Development Tools – MCP Servers  

  **Brand:** SkyCiv  

  **Website:** https://mcp.pipedream.com/app/skyciv


  ### Overview

  SkyCiv MCP Server connects SkyCiv’s cloud-based structural engineering
  software and API to MCP-compatible AI tools. It enables automated access to
  structural analysis and design capabilities from environments like Cursor,
  Claude, and Windsurf.


  ### Features

  - **MCP-compatible server** for integrating SkyCiv with AI development tools
  that support the Model Context Protocol.

  - **Connection to SkyCiv cloud platform**, exposing structural engineering
  analysis and design capabilities programmatically.

  - **API-based access** to SkyCiv functionality for use inside automated or
  AI-assisted workflows.

  - **Integration with AI tools** such as:
    - Cursor
    - Claude
    - Windsurf
  - **Workflow automation** for structural engineering tasks (e.g., running
  analyses, designs, or related computations via MCP requests).


  ### Typical Use Cases

  - Running structural analysis and design checks from within AI coding
  environments.

  - Building automated engineering workflows that call SkyCiv through MCP.

  - Prototyping or iterating on structural models using AI-assisted tools.
