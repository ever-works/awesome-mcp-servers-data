## Overview
IBM wxflows MCP Example is a JavaScript-based reference implementation that demonstrates how to integrate MCP-powered tools into IBM wxflows. It shows how wxflows can be used as a platform to build, test, and deploy tools that work with various data sources via MCP.

## Features
- **JavaScript example project** for integrating MCP with IBM wxflows.
- **Demonstrates MCP tool integration** within the wxflows platform.
- **Shows how to build, test, and deploy tools** in the context of IBM wxflows.
- **Data-source-agnostic pattern** for wiring tools to different data sources through MCP (as supported by wxflows).
- **GitHub-hosted reference** for developers to explore, clone, and adapt.

## Use Cases
- Learning how to connect MCP tools to IBM wxflows.
- Using the JavaScript example as a starting point for custom MCP integrations.
- Prototyping and testing tools that access different data sources through wxflows.
