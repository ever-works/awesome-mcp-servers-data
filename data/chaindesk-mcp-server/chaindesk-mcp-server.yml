  # Chaindesk MCP Server


  An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for integrating Chaindesk-powered
  agents into MCP-compatible clients.


  ## Overview

  Chaindesk MCP Server lets you build and use ChatGPT-style agents trained on
  custom data within MCP ecosystems. It is delivered as a static MCP server
  endpoint hosted by Pipedream Connect.


  ## Features

  - **Custom-data agents**: Use Chaindesk to build agents that are trained on
  your own content and knowledge base.

  - **MCP-compatible server**: Exposes Chaindesk agents via the Model Context
  Protocol for use in compatible chat clients and tools.

  - **Single static endpoint**: Uses a single, static MCP server URL that works
  across clients:
    - `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`
  - **Per-client authentication**: Authentication is handled when you add the
  MCP server to each application or client.

  - **Works with multiple chat clients**: Can be added to different MCP-aware
  chat clients (e.g., ChatGPT or others that support MCP configuration).

  - **Central configuration docs**: Additional setup details are available via a
  configuration page (not included here, but referenced on the source site).


  ## Getting Started

  1. Copy the MCP server URL: `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`.

  2. Add this URL as an MCP server in your MCP-compatible chat client.

  3. Authenticate when prompted by the client.

  4. Configure or select Chaindesk agents trained on your custom data within
  that environment.
