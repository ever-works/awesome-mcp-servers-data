An open-source Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that connects LLM environments to the X (Twitter) API, allowing models to post tweets and search Twitter directly.

- **Docker support**
  - Repository includes a `Dockerfile` for containerized deployment and running the server in a consistent environment.
- **TypeScript/Node.js implementation**
  - Uses a Node.js + TypeScript stack (as indicated by `package.json` and `tsconfig.json`) for the server implementation.
