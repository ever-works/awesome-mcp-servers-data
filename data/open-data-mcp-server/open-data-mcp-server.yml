  ## Description

  Open Data MCP Server is an open-source implementation of the Model Context
  Protocol (MCP), designed to connect open data sources with Large Language
  Models (LLMs). It provides tools for accessing, publishing, and serving public
  datasets as MCP servers, making open data directly accessible to LLM
  applications.


  ## Features

  - **Open-Source MCP Server:** Implements the Model Context Protocol to bridge
  open data and LLMs.

  - **CLI Tool:** Command-line interface for accessing and managing open data
  connections.

  - **Provider Modules:** Supports creation and integration of custom data
  providers (examples included, e.g., Switzerland SBB train data).

  - **Data Publishing:** Tools and guidelines for building and publishing new
  public datasets as MCP providers.

  - **Integration with LLM Clients:** Can be used with LLM desktop apps (such as
  Claude Desktop client) to query connected datasets.

  - **Quickstart Examples:** Includes step-by-step instructions for setting up
  data providers and connecting them to LLMs.

  - **Community Driven:** Open for community contributions, with an active
  roadmap and guidelines for participation.

  - **Testing & Validation:** Includes tools and instructions for testing and
  validating new dataset providers.

  - **Focus on Simplicity and Standardization:** Emphasizes maintainable,
  standardized modules and code quality.

  - **MIT Licensed:** Permissive open-source license.
