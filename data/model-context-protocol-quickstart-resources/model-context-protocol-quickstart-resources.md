# Model Context Protocol Quickstart Resources

## Overview
Model Context Protocol Quickstart Resources is an open-source GitHub repository containing example MCP servers and clients used in the official Model Context Protocol tutorials. It provides ready-made reference implementations and starter code to help developers learn, prototype, and integrate MCP servers and clients.

- **Name:** Model Context Protocol Quickstart Resources  
- **Category:** mcp-server-directories-lists  
- **Vendor / Brand:** model-context-protocol

## Features
- **Official tutorial examples**  
  - Code taken from or aligned with the official Model Context Protocol tutorials.  
  - Serves as a reference for best practices when implementing MCP.

- **Example MCP clients**  
  - `mcp-client-python`: Example MCP client implemented in Python.  
  - `mcp-client-typescript`: Example MCP client implemented in TypeScript.  
  - Useful as starting points for building custom MCP clients in these languages.

- **Example MCP servers (Weather servers)**  
  - `weather-server-python`: Example MCP server implemented in Python.  
  - `weather-server-rust`: Example MCP server implemented in Rust.  
  - `weather-server-typescript`: Example MCP server implemented in TypeScript.  
  - All use a simple “weather” domain to demonstrate MCP server concepts and request/response patterns.

- **Multi-language reference implementations**  
  - Parallel implementations across Python, TypeScript, and Rust for easier comparison of patterns between languages.  
  - Helps developers choose or adapt language-specific patterns for their own MCP projects.

- **Starter code for learning and prototyping**  
  - Minimal, focused examples aimed at understanding how to structure an MCP server or client.  
  - Can be cloned and extended to build production or experimental MCP integrations.

- **GitHub workflows**  
  - `.github/workflows/` directory included for repository-level automation (e.g., tests/CI or checks), providing a reference for basic automation setup around MCP projects.
