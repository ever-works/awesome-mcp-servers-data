    - Client-specific setup instructions are referenced via the configuration page.

    - Suitable for use cases involving AI assistants, workflow automation, and orchestration.

  - **Central configuration**  
    - Configuration handled through a dedicated configuration page (via Pipedream).  
    - Account connection and client selection are part of the setup flow.
