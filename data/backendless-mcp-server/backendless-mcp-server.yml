  ## Backendless MCP Server


  **Category:** Development Tools – MCP Servers  

  **Brand:** Backendless  

  **Slug:** backendless-mcp-server


  ### Description

  Backendless MCP Server is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server integration
  that exposes Backendless’s no-code backend services—such as databases, APIs,
  and real-time capabilities—to MCP-compatible clients. It enables app
  automation and orchestration by allowing chat clients and other MCP tools to
  interact with Backendless as a backend-as-a-service platform.


  ### Features

  - **MCP server integration**
    - Accessible via a static MCP server URL: `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`
    - Can be added to any compatible MCP client or chat application.
  - **No-code backend access**
    - Integrates with Backendless’s no-code backend services.
  - **Database access**
    - Exposes Backendless database operations through MCP (e.g., working with data in Backendless real-time database).
  - **API integration**
    - Provides access to Backendless APIs for backend logic and data operations.
  - **Real-time features**
    - Surfaces Backendless real-time capabilities (e.g., real-time data updates) through MCP.
  - **Visual app platform compatibility**
    - Designed to work with Backendless as a Visual App Development Platform (VADP), including UI Builder and related tooling, when orchestrated via MCP clients.
  - **Static configuration endpoint**
    - Single static URL works across clients; authentication occurs when adding the server within each application.
