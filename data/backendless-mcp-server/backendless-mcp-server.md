### Description
Backendless MCP Server is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server integration that exposes Backendless’s no-code backend services—such as databases, APIs, and real-time capabilities—to MCP-compatible clients. It enables app automation and orchestration by allowing chat clients and other MCP tools to interact with Backendless as a backend-as-a-service platform.

- **Real-time features**
  - Surfaces Backendless real-time capabilities (e.g., real-time data updates) through MCP.
- **Visual app platform compatibility**
  - Designed to work with Backendless as a Visual App Development Platform (VADP), including UI Builder and related tooling, when orchestrated via MCP clients.
