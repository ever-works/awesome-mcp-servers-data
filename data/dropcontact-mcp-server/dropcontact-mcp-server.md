## Overview
Dropcontact MCP Server is an integration for the Dropcontact SaaS solution that allows MCP-based agents and compatible chat clients to enrich, clean, and correct contact data directly through the Model Context Protocol. It connects your MCP-enabled applications to Dropcontact so you can process contact information—especially CRM data—programmatically and without manual intervention.

## Features
- **MCP server integration for Dropcontact**: Exposes Dropcontact’s contact enrichment and cleaning capabilities via the Model Context Protocol.
- **Contact data enrichment**: Enhances existing contact records with additional data fields (e.g., more complete contact or company details), as supported by Dropcontact.
- **Data cleaning and correction**: Automatically cleans and corrects contact data to improve accuracy and consistency in your CRM or other systems.
- **CRM-focused workflows**: Designed to operate directly on CRM contact records so they can be updated and maintained automatically.
- **No human intervention required**: Enables fully automated processing of contact data once configured.
- **Static MCP server URL**: Uses a single endpoint for all clients:  
  `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`
- **Authentication during client setup**: Authentication is handled when you add the server to your MCP-compatible application or chat client.
- **Compatible with multiple chat clients**: Can be added to different MCP-enabled chat interfaces (e.g., AI assistants / agents that support MCP servers).

## Setup
- **Server URL:** `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`
