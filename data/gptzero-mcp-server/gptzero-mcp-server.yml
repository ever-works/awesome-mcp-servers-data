  # GPTZero MCP Server


  **Category:** Security & Attestation MCP Servers  

  **Brand:** GPTZero  

  **Slug:** gptzero-mcp-server


  ## Description

  GPTZero MCP Server is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that exposes
  GPTZero’s AI-generated text detection capabilities to MCP-compatible clients.
  It allows applications and chat clients to submit text for AI content checking
  and classification, enabling detection of AI-generated content (e.g., from
  ChatGPT and other models) within an MCP-based workflow.


  ## Features

  - **MCP-compatible AI detection service**: Provides access to GPTZero’s
  AI-generated text detection and classification via the MCP standard.

  - **AI content checking**: Allows clients to check whether text is likely
  AI-generated, targeting content produced by ChatGPT and other AI models.

  - **Static MCP server endpoint**: Uses a single static URL that works across
  clients:
    - `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`
  - **Works with multiple MCP clients**: Designed to be added to any MCP-capable
  chat client or application.

  - **Authentication at client setup**: Authentication is performed when adding
  the server to the client/app (specific method handled during configuration).

  - **Hosted by Pipedream Connect**: Runs as a managed MCP server through
  Pipedream’s infrastructure, avoiding self-hosting.


  ## Integration & Usage

  - Add the server URL to your MCP-compatible chat client or application.

  - Configure authentication when prompted by the client during server addition.

  - Reference the provider as “GPTZero: Detect AI” within Pipedream Connect.
