## Description
RabbitMQ MCP Server is an MCP-compatible server that integrates with RabbitMQ, exposing RabbitMQ’s reliable messaging and streaming broker capabilities to MCP-based applications and workflows. It is designed to work with RabbitMQ deployments in cloud, on-premises, or local environments.

## Features
- **MCP integration**: Provides a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server interface for RabbitMQ, enabling tools and applications that support MCP to interact with RabbitMQ.
- **Messaging and streaming broker access**: Exposes RabbitMQ’s core messaging and streaming capabilities to MCP-based workflows.
- **Static server URL**: Uses a single static MCP server endpoint (`https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`) that works across compatible clients, with authentication handled when adding the server to an application.
- **Client-agnostic setup**: Can be added to different chat or MCP clients; configuration guidance is available per client type via the configuration page.
- **Cloud, on‑premises, and local compatibility**: Intended to work with RabbitMQ instances deployed in cloud environments, on-premises data centers, or on local machines.
