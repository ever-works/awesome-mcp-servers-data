  ## Description
  Godot MCP is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for interfacing with the Godot game engine. It enables tools and AI assistants to interact with Godot projects, providing capabilities for launching the editor, running projects, capturing debug output, and controlling project execution through a standardized interface.

  ## Features
  - Launch the Godot editor from MCP-compatible clients
  - Run Godot projects programmatically
  - Capture and relay debug output from running projects
  - Control project execution (start, stop, etc.)
  - Standardized interface for integration with AI assistants (e.g., Claude, Cursor, Cline)
  - Flexible configuration through environment variables and project-specific settings
  - Uses a bundled GDScript approach for complex operations, allowing dynamic execution via JSON parameters
  - No need to generate temporary files for each operation
  - Supports integration with multiple clients and development workflows

  ## Installation and Configuration
  - Clone the repository and build the MCP server
  - Configure with an AI assistant (e.g., Cline or Cursor) using the provided configuration options
  - Optional customization via environment variables
