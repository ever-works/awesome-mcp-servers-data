## Description
Pinterest MCP Server is an MCP-compatible integration that connects chat and agentic clients to Pinterest, a visual discovery engine for finding and managing ideas like recipes, home design, style inspiration, and other visual content such as pins and boards.

## Features
- **MCP-compatible endpoint**: Provides a static MCP server URL (`https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`) that works across MCP-supporting clients.
- **Pinterest integration**: Enables interaction with Pinterest visual discovery content (e.g., pins and boards) from MCP-enabled applications.
- **Client-agnostic setup**: Designed to be added to various chat or agentic clients that support MCP.
- **Authentication at connection time**: Uses authentication flow when you add the server to your application (credentials not baked into the static URL).
- **Centralized configuration docs**: Supported by a dedicated configuration page for setup and usage details.

## Getting Started
1. Use the MCP server URL: `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`.
2. Add this URL as a server in your MCP-compatible chat or agent client.
3. Complete the authentication flow when prompted by your client.
4. Refer to the configuration page linked from the source URL for client-specific instructions.
