## Overview
The Octagon Deep Research MCP server is an open-source Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that exposes specialized AI-powered deep research and analysis capabilities. It integrates with Octagon’s deep research agents to power complex, multi-step research workflows directly from MCP-compatible clients.

- **License:** MIT

## Features
- **Deep research agent integration** – Connects to Octagon’s advanced deep research agents to perform comprehensive information gathering and analysis.
- **AI-powered analysis** – Provides structured, in-depth research outputs suitable for complex questions and multi-part tasks.
- **MCP server implementation** – Implements the Model Context Protocol so it can be used as a server with MCP-capable tools and IDEs.
- **Web search–driven workflows** – Uses web search as a primary data source for research tasks (as implied by category and description).
- **Designed for complex workflows** – Intended to power complex, multi-step research workflows rather than simple, single-turn queries.
- **Examples included** – `examples/` directory with example configurations or usage samples for integrating and testing the server.
- **Configurable via environment variables** – `.env.example` provided to configure required keys and settings for running the server.
