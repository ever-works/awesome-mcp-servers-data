  ## Overview

  mcp-language-server is an MCP server that exposes language-server-like,
  semantic code navigation and analysis capabilities to MCP-enabled clients. It
  helps tools understand and work with codebases by providing core
  language-intelligence operations over the MCP protocol.


  ## Features

  - **Semantic code navigation**  
    - Go to / get definition  
    - Find references
  - **Codebase refactoring support**  
    - Rename symbols via semantic analysis
  - **Diagnostics**  
    - Surface diagnostics from the underlying language server(s) through MCP
  - **Language-server-like capabilities over MCP**  
    - Bridges MCP-enabled clients to LSP-style functionality  
    - Designed to help clients navigate and understand codebases semantically

  *(Additional implementation details, supported languages, and configuration
  options are available in the project’s README and source code.)*
