# Polar Signals MCP Server

## Overview
The **Polar Signals MCP Server** is an integration that exposes Polar Signals’ continuous profiling and performance engineering capabilities via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It allows AI agents and other tools running on Metorial to query and analyze profiling data programmatically as part of automated workflows.

## Features
- **Continuous profiling data access**
  - Query continuous profiling data collected from your infrastructure.
  - Retrieve performance information suitable for investigating production behavior.

- **Performance bottleneck analysis**
  - Analyze profiling data to identify performance hotspots in applications and services.
  - Use results to guide optimization and tuning efforts.

- **Resource usage optimization**
  - Inspect CPU, memory, and other resource usage patterns over time.
  - Support decisions on right‑sizing infrastructure and reducing waste.

- **Production issue investigation**
  - Use profiling data to troubleshoot and diagnose performance-related production incidents.
  - Integrate with existing workflows so investigations can be performed directly from your AI or automation environment.

- **MCP-based integration for AI agents**
  - Exposes Polar Signals capabilities over the MCP protocol for programmatic access.
  - Enables AI agents and tools on Metorial to call profiling queries as part of larger automated workflows.

- **Metorial integration**
  - Runs as a deployable MCP server on the Metorial platform.
  - Can be combined with other Metorial integrations (e.g., GitHub, databases, search tools) to build end-to-end observability and remediation workflows.
