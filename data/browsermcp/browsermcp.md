## Features

- **Local browser automation**  
  - Runs automation directly on the user’s machine via a Chrome extension and MCP server.
  - Allows LLMs and AI tools to script and control browser behavior.

- **Integration with AI applications**  
  - Designed to work with MCP-compatible tools such as VS Code, Claude, Cursor, and Windsurf.

- **Performance (Fast)**  
  - Automation is executed locally, reducing reliance on external services and avoiding network latency.

- **Privacy (Private)**  
  - Browser actions are executed on-device; activity is not sent to remote automation servers.

- **Uses existing browser profile (Logged In)**  
  - Operates on the user’s normal Chrome profile.
  - Retains existing logins and session state across websites.

- **Stealth behavior**  
  - Uses the user’s real browser and fingerprint to appear as normal browsing activity.
  - Helps avoid basic bot detection and some CAPTCHA triggers.

- **MCP server implementation**  
  - Exposes browser control as an MCP server so tools that support MCP can access browser automation in a standardized way.
