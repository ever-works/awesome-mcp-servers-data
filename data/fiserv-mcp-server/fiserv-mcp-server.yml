  ## Features


  - **MCP-based access to Fiserv payment services**  
    Provides an MCP (Model Context Protocol) interface to Fiserv’s payment capabilities.

  - **Unified payment acceptance**  
    Designed to accept payments across multiple channels and payment methods (e.g., online, in-app, potentially in-person or other channels supported by Fiserv).

  - **Static MCP server endpoint**  
    Single, reusable MCP server URL for all clients:
    - Base URL: `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`
    - The same endpoint can be used across different applications and chat clients.

  - **Client-agnostic integration**  
    Can be added to various chat clients or MCP-compatible applications; authentication is performed when configuring the server within each client.

  - **Hosted via Pipedream Connect**  
    The MCP server is operated on Pipedream’s infrastructure, removing the need to self-host the MCP server.
