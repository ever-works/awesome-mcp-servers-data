  Provides an MCP (Model Context Protocol) interface to Fiserv’s payment capabilities.

- **Unified payment acceptance**  
  Designed to accept payments across multiple channels and payment methods (e.g., online, in-app, potentially in-person or other channels supported by Fiserv).

- **Static MCP server endpoint**  
  Single, reusable MCP server URL for all clients:
  - Base URL: `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`
  - The same endpoint can be used across different applications and chat clients.

  Can be added to various chat clients or MCP-compatible applications; authentication is performed when configuring the server within each client.
