  # Resource Guru MCP Server


  ## Overview

  The Resource Guru MCP Server is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that
  connects AI tools to Resource Guru, enabling resource management, scheduling,
  and utilization workflows via a static MCP endpoint.


  - **Type:** MCP server / integration

  - **Category:** Project management / resource management

  - **Provider:** Pipedream

  - **MCP Server URL:** `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`


  ## Features

  - **Static MCP Endpoint**  
    - Single, static MCP server URL (`https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`) used for all clients.  
    - Authentication occurs when adding the server to your application.

  - **Resource Guru Integration**  
    - Designed to work with Resource Guru, a resource management and scheduling platform.  
    - Intended to expose Resource Guru actions and tools (e.g., managing resources, schedules, and utilization) via MCP-compatible clients.  
    - Actions and tools are loaded dynamically from the Pipedream-powered MCP server.

  - **Client-Agnostic Setup**  
    - Can be added to various chat or MCP-compatible clients.  
    - Documentation available for different chat clients via the configuration flow.

  - **Configuration Flow**  
    - Connect a Resource Guru account and select a client to get started.  
    - Guided configuration through a dedicated configuration page on Pipedream.

  - **Pipedream-Backed Hosting**  
    - MCP server infrastructure and configuration hosted and managed by Pipedream.

  ## How It Works

  1. Copy the static MCP server URL: `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`.  

  2. Add this URL as an MCP server in your chosen client.  

  3. Authenticate with your Resource Guru account during setup.  

  4. Use the available tools/actions exposed by the server to manage Resource
  Guru resources and schedules through your AI client.
