## Overview
Reward Sciences MCP Server is an integration that connects the Reward Sciences incentives and rewards platform to MCP-compatible applications. It allows organizations to automate incentive and reward workflows around user or employee behaviors directly from MCP-based tools (such as chat clients).

## Features
- **MCP-based integration**: Exposes Reward Sciences functionality as an MCP Server so it can be used within MCP-capable apps and agents.
- **Behavior-driven incentives and rewards**: Designed to automate rewards and incentives tied to human behaviors that benefit the business.
- **Static server endpoint**: Uses a single static MCP server URL for all clients:
  - `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`
- **Account-based authentication**: Authentication occurs when adding the server to the client application, allowing secure use of Reward Sciences features via MCP.
- **Multi-client support**: Can be added to various chat or MCP-compatible clients; configuration guidance is available per client type.
- **Central configuration**: Configuration is managed through a dedicated setup flow where you connect your Reward Sciences account and select the relevant client.
