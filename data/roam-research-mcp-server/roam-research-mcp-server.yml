  ## Overview

  Roam Research MCP Server is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that

  to AI agents. It allows applications and chat clients that support MCP to
  query and manage Roam graphs programmatically.


  ## Features

  - **MCP-compatible server endpoint**  
    - Static server URL for all supported clients: `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`

    - Enables AI agents and tools to work with Roam’s networked note-taking environment and knowledge graphs.

  - **Authentication flow**  
    - Authentication occurs when adding the server to the client/application (no per-client URL needed).

  - **Client setup guidance**  
    - Instructions available per chat client on how to add and configure the MCP server.  
    - Links to a configuration page for more detailed setup steps.

  - **Tool exposure for agents**  
    - Exposes “available tools” (actions) over MCP for interacting with Roam (listed dynamically in the UI as “Loading actions…/Loading available tools…”).
