- **Access to premium Garry’s Mod content**: Connects to the GmodStore marketplace that offers a variety of premium content for Garry’s Mod servers.
- **Job listings integration**: Enables interaction with GmodStore job listings, where server owners can create listings and reach a broad audience of Garry’s Mod content creators.
- **Static MCP server URL**: Uses a single static MCP endpoint for all clients:

- **Client-agnostic endpoint**: The same MCP server URL works across different chat clients and tools that support MCP.
