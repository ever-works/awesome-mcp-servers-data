  workflows.

  - **Category:** Data Access & Integration – MCP Servers

  - **Brand:** Retable

  - **MCP Server URL:** `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`


  ## Overview

  The Retable MCP Server is an MCP-compatible service that connects Retable’s
  spreadsheet-like data to applications that support the Model Context Protocol
  (MCP). It lets you treat Retable tables as structured, queryable databases
  inside MCP-enabled workflows and chat clients.


  ## Features

  - **MCP-compatible server** – Exposes Retable data through a standard MCP
  server endpoint (`https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`).

  - **Spreadsheet-to-database abstraction** – Treats Retable’s spreadsheet-style
  tables as smart databases suitable for programmatic access.

  - **Workflow integration** – Designed to be used inside MCP workflows,
  allowing models and tools to read from and act on Retable data.

  - **Static server URL** – Single static URL works across MCP clients;
  authentication is handled when adding the server to each application.

  - **Client-agnostic setup** – Can be added to different MCP-enabled chat
  clients and tools using the same endpoint.


  ## Integration & Setup

  - Use the static MCP server URL: `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`.

  - Add this URL as an MCP server in your compatible chat client or application.

  - Authenticate during the add/connect flow in your client.

  - Additional configuration guidance is available on the Pipedream MCP
  Configuration page (linked from the product page).
