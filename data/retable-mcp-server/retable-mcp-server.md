## Overview
The Retable MCP Server is an MCP-compatible service that connects Retable’s spreadsheet-like data to applications that support the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It lets you treat Retable tables as structured, queryable databases inside MCP-enabled workflows and chat clients.

## Features
- **MCP-compatible server** – Exposes Retable data through a standard MCP server endpoint (`https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`).
- **Spreadsheet-to-database abstraction** – Treats Retable’s spreadsheet-style tables as smart databases suitable for programmatic access.
- **Workflow integration** – Designed to be used inside MCP workflows, allowing models and tools to read from and act on Retable data.
- **Static server URL** – Single static URL works across MCP clients; authentication is handled when adding the server to each application.
- **Client-agnostic setup** – Can be added to different MCP-enabled chat clients and tools using the same endpoint.

## Integration & Setup
- Use the static MCP server URL: `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`.
- Add this URL as an MCP server in your compatible chat client or application.
- Authenticate during the add/connect flow in your client.
- Additional configuration guidance is available on the Pipedream MCP Configuration page (linked from the product page).
