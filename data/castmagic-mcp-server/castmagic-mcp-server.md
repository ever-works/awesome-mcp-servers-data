## Overview
Castmagic MCP Server is an MCP-compatible service (powered by Pipedream Connect) that allows MCP-based agents and clients to transform and repurpose audio content using AI. It exposes a static MCP server URL that can be integrated with different chat or agent clients.

## Features
- **MCP-compatible server**: Implements the Model Context Protocol (MCP) so agents and clients that support MCP can connect and interact with the service.
- **Static server URL**: Uses a single, static MCP endpoint (`https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`) for all supported clients; configuration does not depend on client-specific URLs.
- **Client-agnostic integration**: Designed to work with multiple chat clients and MCP-enabled applications; you authenticate when adding the server to your chosen app.
- **AI-powered audio handling**: Intended to help transform and repurpose audio content via AI (e.g., for content repackaging and reuse) through the MCP interface.
- **Configuration guidance**: Documentation and configuration instructions available via a dedicated configuration page for setting up the MCP server within supported clients.

## Usage
- Add `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2` as the MCP server URL in your MCP-capable client.
- Authenticate within your application when prompted.
- Follow the client-specific or configuration-page instructions to complete setup.
