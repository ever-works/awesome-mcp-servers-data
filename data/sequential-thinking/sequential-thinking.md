## Sequential Thinking

**Category:** MCP Server – Directories & Lists

### Description
Sequential Thinking is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server focused on dynamic, reflective problem solving. It structures reasoning into explicit, sequential thought steps to help handle complex tasks in a more organized and transparent way.

### Features
- **MCP server implementation** for use within MCP-compatible toolchains and environments.
- **Sequential reasoning structure** that breaks down problems into ordered thought steps.
- **Reflective problem solving** capabilities, enabling reconsideration and refinement of intermediate steps.
- **Designed for complex task handling**, where multi-step reasoning and explicit structure improve clarity and control.

### Use Cases
- Running complex, multi-step reasoning workflows through an MCP-compatible client.
- Scenarios where you need explicit, step-by-step traceability of an AI’s thought process.
- Tasks that benefit from reflective iteration over intermediate reasoning steps.
