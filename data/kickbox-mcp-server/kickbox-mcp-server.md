## Overview
Kickbox MCP Server integrates Kickbox’s email deliverability and verification capabilities into MCP-aware workflows via Pipedream. It is accessed through a static MCP server URL that can be used across compatible clients and applications.

## Features
- **Email verification integration**: Connects Kickbox’s email verification services into MCP-aware tools and workflows.
- **Deliverability tooling integration**: Uses the Kickbox Deliverability Suite to help assess and improve the likelihood of emails reaching the inbox.
- **Static MCP server endpoint**: Single server URL usable across all supported MCP clients:
  - `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`
- **Client-agnostic configuration**: The same server URL can be added to different MCP-aware chat clients and applications.
- **Authentication at configuration time**: Authentication occurs when adding the server to an application, rather than using client-specific URLs.
- **Centralized configuration reference**: Additional configuration details are available via a dedicated configuration page (linked from the app page).

## Usage
1. Copy the MCP server URL: `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`.
2. Add the server URL to your MCP-aware chat client or application.
