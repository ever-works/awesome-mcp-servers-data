Reform MCP Server is an MCP server integration, provided via Pipedream, that connects Reform’s AI-driven paperwork automation to MCP-compatible clients. It is designed for logistics workflows, enabling automation of document-related tasks within AI chat or MCP-based applications.

## Features

- **Paperwork automation focus**: Tailored to logistics industry paperwork and document-heavy workflows.
- **Configuration documentation**: A dedicated configuration page is available (via Pipedream) to guide setup and integration.
- **Hosted by Pipedream Connect**: Runs on Pipedream’s infrastructure, eliminating the need to self-host the MCP server.

## Usage
