  ## Description

  Scale AI MCP Server connects Model Context Protocol (MCP) clients to Scale
  AI’s data and generative AI platform. It enables operations related to dataset
  management and model workflows by exposing Scale AI capabilities through a
  standardized MCP endpoint.


  ## Features

  - **MCP-compatible endpoint**: Provides a static MCP server URL that can be
  used from any compatible MCP client.

  - **Single URL for all clients**: Uses a universal MCP endpoint
  (`https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`) that works across supported chat and MCP
  clients.

  - **Authentication at client setup**: Authentication is handled when adding
  the server to an application, allowing secure access to Scale AI services.

  - **Access to Scale AI platforms**:
    - Connects to Scale Data Engine to leverage enterprise data.
    - Connects to Scale Generative AI Platform to use generative AI features and model-related workflows.
  - **Client-agnostic integration**: Can be added to different chat or
  MCP-enabled clients, following configuration steps specific to each client.

  - **Central configuration docs**: Full configuration details are available via
  a dedicated configuration page (linked from the app page).
