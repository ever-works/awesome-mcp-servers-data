**Website:** https://mcp.pipedream.com/app/vectorshift  
**Category:** AI Integration – MCP Servers  
**Brand:** VectorShift

## Overview
VectorShift MCP Server is an integration that exposes the VectorShift end-to-end AI automations platform through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It allows compatible MCP clients (such as chat applications and development tools) to connect to VectorShift via a static MCP server URL.

## Features
- **MCP-compatible endpoint**  
  - Provides a static MCP server URL: `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2` for connecting MCP-capable clients.

- **VectorShift platform access**  
  - Connects MCP clients to VectorShift’s end-to-end AI automations platform.  
  - Designed for AI workflows, automation, and LLM-based integrations.

- **Account-based configuration**  
  - Users connect their VectorShift account and select a client to start using the integration.

- **Client-agnostic setup**  
  - The same static URL works for every supported client; authentication occurs when adding the server in the application.

- **Configuration guidance**  
  - Documentation via a configuration page explaining how to add and use the server in different chat clients / MCP-compatible apps.

- **Tool exposure (via MCP)**  
  - Intended to expose VectorShift tools and actions as MCP tools (UI indicates “available tools” / “loading actions”), enabling automated workflows from within MCP clients.

## Usage
1. Connect a VectorShift account in the Pipedream VectorShift MCP Server app.  
2. Copy the static MCP server URL: `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`.  
3. Add this URL as an MCP server in a compatible chat or development client.
