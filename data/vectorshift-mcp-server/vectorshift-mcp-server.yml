  # VectorShift MCP Server


  **Website:** https://mcp.pipedream.com/app/vectorshift  

  **Category:** AI Integration – MCP Servers  

  **Brand:** VectorShift


  ## Overview

  VectorShift MCP Server is an integration that exposes the VectorShift
  end-to-end AI automations platform through the Model Context Protocol (MCP).
  It allows compatible MCP clients (such as chat applications and development
  tools) to connect to VectorShift via a static MCP server URL.


  ## Features

  - **MCP-compatible endpoint**  
    - Provides a static MCP server URL: `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2` for connecting MCP-capable clients.

  - **VectorShift platform access**  
    - Connects MCP clients to VectorShift’s end-to-end AI automations platform.  
    - Designed for AI workflows, automation, and LLM-based integrations.

  - **Account-based configuration**  
    - Users connect their VectorShift account and select a client to start using the integration.

  - **Client-agnostic setup**  
    - The same static URL works for every supported client; authentication occurs when adding the server in the application.

  - **Configuration guidance**  
    - Documentation via a configuration page explaining how to add and use the server in different chat clients / MCP-compatible apps.

  - **Tool exposure (via MCP)**  
    - Intended to expose VectorShift tools and actions as MCP tools (UI indicates “available tools” / “loading actions”), enabling automated workflows from within MCP clients.

  ## Usage

  1. Connect a VectorShift account in the Pipedream VectorShift MCP Server
  app.  

  2. Copy the static MCP server URL: `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`.  

  3. Add this URL as an MCP server in a compatible chat or development client.  

  4. Authenticate when prompted and access the tools exposed by VectorShift
  through MCP.
