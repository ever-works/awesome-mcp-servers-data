  # MSSQL MCP Server (aekanun2020)


  ## Description

  An MSSQL MCP server that connects Large Language Models (LLMs) to Microsoft
  SQL Server databases. It provides database integration with configurable
  access controls and schema inspection to support safer, controlled interaction
  with SQL Server instances.


  ## Features

  - **MSSQL integration** – Connects to Microsoft SQL Server databases for
  querying and interaction.

  - **Configurable access controls** – Allows configuration of what the MCP/LLM
  is permitted to access, helping limit operations and data exposure.

  - **Schema inspection** – Supports inspection of database schema (tables,
  columns, etc.) so the LLM can understand available structures.

  - **Safe LLM database access** – Designed to enable safer LLM access to SQL
  Server databases by combining schema visibility with access controls.
