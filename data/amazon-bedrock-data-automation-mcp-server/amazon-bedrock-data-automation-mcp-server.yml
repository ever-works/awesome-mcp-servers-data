  ## Overview
  Amazon Bedrock Data Automation MCP Server is an MCP-compatible server designed to integrate Amazon Bedrock’s multimodal AI capabilities into agent platforms that support the Model Context Protocol (such as Salesforce Agentforce). It automates analysis of documents, images, videos, and audio, enabling AI agents to process diverse content types through a unified, standards-based interface.

  ## Features
  - **MCP-compatible server**  
    - Implements the Model Context Protocol so it can plug into MCP-capable agent platforms and marketplaces (e.g., AgentExchange).

  - **Multimodal content processing**  
    - Supports automated analysis of multiple content types via Amazon Bedrock models:  
      - Text documents  
      - Images  
      - Video  
      - Audio

  - **Automated data analysis for agents**  
    - Exposes tools and operations that allow AI agents to:  
      - Ingest files and media  
      - Run AI-powered analysis over the content  
      - Return structured outputs that agents can use for downstream tasks.

  - **Integration into open agent ecosystems**  
    - Designed to participate in open, interoperable AI ecosystems based on MCP.  
    - Can be listed and consumed as an MCP server in marketplaces that support partner MCP servers (e.g., AgentExchange).

  - **Support for digital labor / agent workflows**  
    - Enables autonomous or semi-autonomous agents to offload media and document understanding tasks to Bedrock via a standardized protocol.  
    - Helps integrate media analysis into broader business workflows orchestrated by agents.

  - **Enterprise-focused interoperability**  
    - Intended for use in enterprise agent environments that emphasize governance and security controls, taking advantage of the trust and governance layers provided by MCP-capable platforms.

  ## Use Cases
  - Automated document understanding and summarization for AI agents.  
  - Image, video, and audio content analysis inside agent workflows.  
  - Building composite agents that rely on Amazon Bedrock for multimodal perception while other tools handle business logic and actions.
