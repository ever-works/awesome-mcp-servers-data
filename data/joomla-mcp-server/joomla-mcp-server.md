# Joomla! MCP Server

## Overview
The Joomla! MCP Server is an integration that exposes Joomla!, a free and open-source CMS and MVC web application framework, as a Model–Context–Protocol (MCP) server. It enables MCP-compatible applications and chat clients to interact with Joomla-based web content and applications via a standardized server endpoint.

## Features
- **MCP server integration for Joomla!**: Connects Joomla! to MCP-compatible environments so tools and clients can interact with Joomla content and functionality.
- **Static MCP server endpoint**: Uses a single static URL (`https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`) that works for every client; authentication is handled when the server is added to the application.
- **MVC-based web application framework**: Leverages Joomla’s model–view–controller architecture for structured, extensible web application and content management.
- **Web content publishing**: Uses Joomla’s CMS capabilities for publishing and managing web content within an MCP-integrated setup.
- **Integration with chat clients and apps**: Designed to be added as a server to various chat clients or applications, enabling them to call tools/actions exposed via Joomla.
- **Configuration guidance**: Provides a configuration flow (via a configuration page) for connecting accounts and selecting clients to start using the server.

## Technical Details
- **MCP server URL**: `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`
- **Architecture**: Built around Joomla’s MVC web application framework and CMS capabilities.
