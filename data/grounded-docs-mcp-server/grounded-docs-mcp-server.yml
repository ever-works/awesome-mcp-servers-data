  ## Overview

  Grounded Docs MCP Server is an open‑source Model Context Protocol (MCP) server
  that exposes documentation and other grounded technical content as tools to
  MCP‑compatible AI clients. It enables AI coding assistants to query and
  retrieve up‑to‑date, context‑aware documentation directly within their
  environment to improve code assistance and reduce context switching.


  ## Features

  - **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server** for integrating external
  documentation into AI assistants.

  - **Documentation search and retrieval** exposed as tools to MCP‑compatible
  clients.

  - **Grounded, technical content focus** to improve reliability of AI-generated
  answers.

  - **Context‑aware responses** by supplying relevant docs snippets to the
  assistant.

  - **Supports multiple documentation sources** (via configuration and
  integrations in the repo structure, e.g., `docs/`, `db/migrations/`,
  `public/`).

  - **Open‑source codebase** hosted on GitHub for inspection, modification, and
  self‑hosting.

  - **MIT license** allowing commercial and non‑commercial use, modification,
  and redistribution.

  - **Scripted tooling** (via `scripts/` directory) to aid setup, development,
  and deployment.

  - **Testing infrastructure** (`test/` directory) to validate behavior and
  reliability.

  - **Configuration via environment variables** (example in `.env.example`).

  - **Docker-related configuration** (e.g., `.dockerignore`) to support
  containerized deployment.

  - **Automated workflows** (GitHub Actions in `.github/workflows`) for CI/CD
  and release automation.


  ## Pricing

  - The project is **free and open‑source** under the MIT License. No paid plans
