## Overview
Grounded Docs MCP Server is an open‑source Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that exposes documentation and other grounded technical content as tools to MCP‑compatible AI clients. It enables AI coding assistants to query and retrieve up‑to‑date, context‑aware documentation directly within their environment to improve code assistance and reduce context switching.

## Features
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server** for integrating external documentation into AI assistants.
- **Documentation search and retrieval** exposed as tools to MCP‑compatible clients.
- **Grounded, technical content focus** to improve reliability of AI-generated answers.
- **Context‑aware responses** by supplying relevant docs snippets to the assistant.
- **Supports multiple documentation sources** (via configuration and integrations in the repo structure, e.g., `docs/`, `db/migrations/`, `public/`).
- **Open‑source codebase** hosted on GitHub for inspection, modification, and self‑hosting.
- **MIT license** allowing commercial and non‑commercial use, modification, and redistribution.
- **Scripted tooling** (via `scripts/` directory) to aid setup, development, and deployment.
- **Testing infrastructure** (`test/` directory) to validate behavior and reliability.
- **Configuration via environment variables** (example in `.env.example`).
- **Docker-related configuration** (e.g., `.dockerignore`) to support containerized deployment.
- **Automated workflows** (GitHub Actions in `.github/workflows`) for CI/CD and release automation.
