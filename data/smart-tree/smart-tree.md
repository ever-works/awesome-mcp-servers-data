## Description
smart-tree is an AI-native directory visualization and browsing tool that exposes file-system structure and compressed project context to large language models via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It functions as a file-system–oriented MCP server to enable semantic directory exploration and context sharing for AI assistants.

## Features
- **AI-native directory visualization**
  - Represents file-system structure in a form optimized for LLM consumption.
  - Provides a “tree-like” overview of directories and files for navigation.

- **MCP server for file systems**
  - Acts as a file-system–oriented MCP server.
  - Enables tools and AI assistants that support MCP to query and browse local or project directories.
  - Designed for semantic directory browsing instead of purely path-based access.

- **Context exposure and compression**
  - Exposes compressed context about files and directories to LLMs.
  - Shares summarized or structured information about project contents rather than raw files only.
  - Aims to support large projects by compressing context before sending it to models.

- **Semantic directory browsing**
  - Focuses on meaning and relationships between files instead of only hierarchical file paths.
  - Intended to help AI systems understand how files relate within a codebase or project.

- **Integration with AI assistants**
  - Built for LLM-based tools that use MCP.
  - Provides directory and context information as a backend service to AI coding or productivity agents.

> Note: The repository description references additional capabilities (e.g., “semantic search”, “AST-smart editing”, “partnership memory”, “MEM8 quantum compression”), but the provided content does not give implementation details.
