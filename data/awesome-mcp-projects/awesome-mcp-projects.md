## Overview
`awesome mcp projects` is a GitHub repository intended as a curated directory of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and related resources. It focuses on reference implementations and community-built servers that demonstrate how MCP can provide Large Language Models with secure, controlled access to external tools and data sources.

## Features

- **Curated MCP Server List**
  - Collects MCP server implementations and related resources in one place.
  - Maintains lists in alphabetical order to reduce merge conflicts and keep contributions organized.

- **Reference Implementations**
  - Includes example / reference MCP servers demonstrating core protocol capabilities.
  - Shows how to implement MCP servers using:
    - **TypeScript MCP SDK**
    - **Python MCP SDK**

- **Demonstrated Use Cases**
  - **AWS KB Retrieval**
    - Retrieves content from AWS Knowledge Bases via Bedrock Agent Runtime.
  - **Brave Search**
    - Provides web and local search functionality using Brave’s Search API.
  - **EverArt**
    - AI image generation using multiple models.
  - **Everything**
    - General reference/test server showcasing prompts, resources, and tools.
  - **Fetch**
    - Fetches web content and converts it into formats suitable for efficient LLM consumption.
  - **Filesystem**
    - Secure file operations with configurable access controls, enabling controlled file read/write.
  - **Git**
    - Tools to read, search, and manipulate Git repositories (partially described; intended for repo operations via MCP).

- **Security & Control Emphasis**
  - Example servers illustrate secure, permissioned access to external systems and data.

- **Community-Oriented**
