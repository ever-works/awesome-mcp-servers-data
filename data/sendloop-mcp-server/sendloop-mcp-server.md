Sendloop MCP Server is an integration that exposes Sendloop’s email marketing capabilities through the Model Context Protocol (MCP) via Pipedream. It allows compatible chat or AI clients to create, send, and track email marketing campaigns programmatically.

## Features

- **MCP-compatible HTTP endpoint**  
  - Static MCP server URL: `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`  
  - Works with any MCP-capable client; authentication is handled when adding the server to the application.

- **Email campaign management (via Sendloop)**  
  - Create email marketing campaigns.  
  - Send campaigns to your subscriber lists.  
  - Track campaign performance and engagement metrics.

- **Integration via Pipedream Connect**  
  - Server is hosted and powered by Pipedream Connect.  
  - Central configuration through Pipedream’s MCP configuration page (for supported clients).

- **Client-agnostic setup**  
  - Single static URL for all clients; no client-specific endpoints required.  
  - Can be added to multiple chat / AI applications that support MCP.

## How It Works

1. Use the static MCP server URL `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2` in your MCP-compatible client.  
2. Authenticate when prompted by your application.  
3. Invoke Sendloop-related tools/endpoints exposed via MCP to create, send, and track email campaigns.
