## Overview
PixieBrix MCP Server is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that connects AI agents to the PixieBrix AI engagement and browser augmentation platform. It is provided via Pipedream Connect as a static MCP endpoint that can be added to compatible chat or AI clients.

## Features
- **MCP-compatible server**: Exposes PixieBrix capabilities over a standard MCP server endpoint.  
- **Static MCP URL**: Single server URL that works for every compatible client:  
  - `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`  
- **Client-agnostic setup**: Designed to be added to different MCP-enabled chat or AI applications; configuration is done on the client side.
- **Authentication at connection time**: Authentication is performed when adding the server to your application, rather than using client-specific URLs.
- **Integration with PixieBrix platform**: Allows AI agents to leverage PixieBrix’s AI engagement and browser augmentation features within MCP-based workflows.
- **Workflow automation support**: Can be used as part of broader AI and workflow automation setups through Pipedream Connect.

## Usage
- Add `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2` as an MCP server in your MCP-compatible chat or AI client.  
- Follow your client’s instructions (or the Pipedream configuration page) to authenticate and complete setup.
