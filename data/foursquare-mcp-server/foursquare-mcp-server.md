## Overview
The Foursquare MCP Server is an integration endpoint that exposes Foursquare’s independent location data platform through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It allows compatible MCP clients and chat applications to access Foursquare place and location datasets via a unified MCP server URL.

## Features
- **MCP-compatible server endpoint**  
  - Provides a static MCP server URL: `https://mcp.pipedream.net/v2`  
  - Can be added to any supported MCP client or chat application.

- **Access to Foursquare location data**  
  - Integrates with Foursquare’s independent location data platform.  
  - Designed to surface rich place and location datasets through MCP-aware tools.

- **Account-based configuration**  
  - Connect a Foursquare-related account via the Pipedream interface.  
  - Select a client (chat app or MCP client) after connecting the account.

- **Client-agnostic setup**  
  - Same static MCP URL for all supported clients.  
  - Authentication handled when adding the server to your application.

- **Guided configuration**  
  - Client-specific instructions available for adding the server to different chat clients.  
  - A dedicated configuration page (via Pipedream) with details on setup and usage.
